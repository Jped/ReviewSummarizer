            "review_text": "I got some smart plugs so that I could turn on inside lights if we come home after dark with the app on my phone. My 82 y.o. Dad lives with me & has a hard time walking & he's also losing his ability to see at all in the dark, because of Macular Degeneration. So the last thing I need is him tripping over something in the dark, trying to turn lights on!! I have an Echo & Dot in my room, which I mostly use to stream music with my Amazon Music Unlimited. I was controlling even his bedroom light & the hallway light with the app on my phone as well as my Echo. So I bought two more Dots during prime day sale. It's been a game changer!! My Dad struggled, even with the app on his phone to control the lights. Now that we have a Dot in his bedroom & an Echo & Dot in the living room, he's very easily learned how to ask Alexa to turn on the hallway light, his bedroom light when he's going to bed!! NO MORE STUMBLING AROUND IN THE DARK or trying to remember where he put his flashlight!! Since the Echo Dots all sync together, once he gets to his bedroom, he tells Alexa to turn off the living room light & the hallway light when he gets to his bedroom!! This little device is a SAVING GRACE, not only for my Dad, but for me!! I don't have him calling me to \"Show me again how to turn the lights on/off\" with his phone app!! It's like having someone else here that helps me take care of my Dad!! I made a list of the commands for the lights, etc & hung one on his night stand & put the other beside his chair in the living room!! He's also exploring, BY HIMSELF, different commands for Alexa. I've heard him ask her about the weather, baseball scores, etc. THIS LITTLE ITEM IS A TRUE GEM FOR SENIORS!! I love mine just as much & the quality of the sound thru the Echo is AMAZING for listening to music. I'm VERY PICKY about sound quality!! I have Bose speakers hooked up to my TV & have Bose ear buds as well. The quality of the sound from the Echo is just as good as Bose speakers!!",

            "review_text": "Let me preface this review by revealing a few facts about myself. I am male, aged 75 years old, and more tech savvy than most people my age, but if you can use a modern computer, and own one, you should have not problem using this device. IT IS SO FAR, MIRACULOUS, and intriguing! I bought mine about a week ago, and waited till a couple days ago to jump in with \"both feet\" and set it up. Even though I once did computer tech support for Dell computers, It was a long time ago now, and a lot of tech has evolved since then, and i have the same fear of new things as most people my age, though admittedly higher skills. I also own an Iphone 6s plus, of which I have mixed emotions. The Iphone is made by apple, and Apple's idea of \"intuitive\" and mine are very different. Microsoft is much better at designing \"intuitive\" into an operating system than Apple. Aniyway, You will need some type of connected WIFI device to use this product. (read that Cell Phone with it's own WIFI abilities, and Bluetooth built in) You will need to download the \"Alexa App. \" on that device to set up the Alexa products. From that point on, simply plug in the Echo device into a regular 110V. wall outlet, it comes with a plug in adapter. There are no batteries in this device, although some have them. A NOTE HERE\" YES, YOU CAN UNPLUG IT WITHOUT IT LOSING ITS BRAINS AND REQUIRING REPEAT SET UP. So though not specified anywhere I read it evidently has some on board nonvolatile memory built in that will allow this. ( i spent several research sessions attempting to find this out, and finally had to bite the bullet and just try it. ) I moved it from one room location to another and within a few seconds it greeted me and said it was operational. NOW I AM ONLY AN OLD GUY WITH PRETTY GOOD HEARING ABILITIES YET, (NOT EXACTLY AN AUDIOPHILE ) BUT WITH DOLBY DIGITAL SOUND, THIS IS ONE NICE SOUNDING SPEAKER SYSTEM, FULLY AS GOOD AS MY 7 SPEAKER ALTECH LANSING ON MY PC. IT MAY EVEN BE BETTER.IF YOU HAVE A NORMAL EAR, YOU WILL BE AMAZED AT THE SOUND QUALITY! Now I am still learning about this product. Every new thing I try I am pleasantly surprised. I plan to get at least a smart home door lock and thermostat to use with it in the future, and several light switches. I am no great fan of the \"RING DOORBELL\" (due to frequently needed battery recharging) at this point, but I understand Amazon has purchased that company and will soon have an interface app available to use with the \"Ring System\" If you want to keep up with the march of technology, this device is probably your best doorway to that end, since Amazon is committed to pursuing it. Others may drop out along the way. (NEW) I made a hands free phone call to my son this moring as a test of the phone capabilities. Sound on my end was like he was in the room. The Alexa app and it's capabilities are evolving technologies. Features will be added. (Mine did an update download while playing music) Don't be disappointed. It is attractively packed, and very capable, but the \"instructions\" are not detailed and are sketchy. Lean about it online as I did before you purchase it. Read as many reviews as your eyes and attention span will allow, and take the plunge! An education awaits you!",

            "review_text": "My mother is 84 years old and she struggles talking on a cell phone, and I struggle to hear her. She kept bumping the cell phone up against her chin, and when I talked to her I hear numerous beeps when we are talking like someone was dialing out. She is having trouble holding the cell phone up to her head. I talked my mom in to getting an Amazon Echo as a gift from me. My sister helped to set it up since I am in another state. When you make a call with the Echo, it uses the phone number associated with the cell phone that is on your Amazon account. So I changed that to my mothers cell number. So when she makes a call, it shows up as her cell phone number on the Caller ID. Now all she has to do is say \"Alexa call Greg\", and the Echo dials me up, and anyone in her contact list. She rests comfortably in her easy chair, and she can hear everything I say through the Echo, and I can hear everything my mother says very clearly. She can also ask Alexa to dial any number, that is very helpful as well. This feature alone was well worth the price of buying an Amazon Echo. My mother is learning very quickly all the other skills Alexa is able to do, weather, music, audiobooks, trivia questions, etc. Now that I am able to talk to my mother with ease. I would have to say this is the BEST gadget I have ever bought on Amazon. Attached is a Voice Mail from my mother, and how much she LOVES the Amazon Echo",

When I hooked it up and played some music thru it, and then told Alexa to stop, the music continued to play for a short burst. I do not have that problem with my Gen 1. I contacted Amazon and they sent me a new one without a hassle. When I hooked the replacement up, the same issue was there. On Nov 3rd I contacted the Amazon Echo department, and they advised me that there was a known issue with the music on the Gen 2, and it would be fixed by Nov 6th. Well, today is Nov 8th and nothing's changed, so regrettably I am returning my second Gen 2. I might add, after reading other reviews, I agree that the quality of the sound from the Gen 2 is, at best, worse than my Gen 1. Voices are muffled and music is not crisp. Amazon's claim of improved sound was my major reason for purchasing this 2nd generation device. It was indeed a disappointment.",

If you go to the Alexa app and choose your device ---> settings and then history you'll find a long list of recordings the echo has made while secretly listening into your home. I had no idea this was happening and I find it very creepy. Nobody was using the wake word, etc. It just listened in and then recorded bits of conversation. I'm getting rid of them. **UPDATE** I discussed this issue with Customer Service who, by the way, have the best Rep's in the world. Their engineers reviewed my data and concluded the sounds being recorded were coming from a TV in the room. At first it was hard to agree with them but after I listened over and over to a few of the recordings it was apparent it was from the TV. My Bad!! I'm back to being an Echo fan. \ud83d\ude0a",

            "review_text": "Bought one and tried echo 2nd gen and was impressed by the sound quality (it was close to \"surround sound\" quality) so I bought 4 more echo 2nd gen and everyone in my household was happy with all of 'em. After 4 months past, I noticed the sound is not quite awesome as it was (now, it sounded like \"mono\") seems like the bass is not sync, something about the sound is off. Seems like Amazon pushed out an update and downgraded the sound quality. It still plays music at sub-par quality but that's not what I paid for! Amazon, please maintain the quality of your products. [UPDATE:] 8/15/2018 Amazon's review team has informed me that they've added an equalizer feature....that's fantastic! Now I have to adjust the bass, midrange and treble myself to try and get the best sound quality....great! I know some people has requested this feature and Amazon is awesome for listening and responding to customers. When I buy a smart gadget I expect to get rid off some of the guess work but It's also good to have an override switch to everything. People nowadays likes plug-n-play, set-n-forget but also wants to tinker to get to that sweet spot, I know! people are complicated but so as music. And did I mention I have 5 of these? so that means I have to tinker on each one? and tinker again for every music being played? PROPOSED SOLUTION (for your developers): Make the echo smart enough to determine (by itself) the best sound quality for the music being played and this will be known as the auto sound feature which is shipped by default - this will cater to mostly everyone. And the equalizer will be known as the manual sound feature that will cater the rest.",

I had read other reviews where folks weren't happy with the sound quality of the speaker during music playback. I must admit that after I set up the first unit and played some music I would tend to agree. Flat base and a bit washed out over all. But Wait!! There's good news. As I set up the second and third Echos the first unit that had been set up for 10 minutes or so said, \"I'm updating, I'll be available shortly\". One by one each speaker received an update from Amazon and I have no idea how but after updating they sound \"AMAZING\" Full, rich base, excellent vocals and overall sounds as good as my JBL or UE Boom. If you are thinking of getting these but were afraid after reading the not so great sound quality reviews, go ahead. You will be more than pleased after receiving the updated software.

            "review_text": "We purchased the 1st Gen Echo as a refurbished unit for $127.00 Nov 9th 2016. Could not tell it was a referb and we enjoyed it, asking Alexa silly and meaningful questions. We also used the 1st Gen unit for music and enjoyed the fidelity the Echo provided and the Amazon music and Ihart music stations. We would have purchased more units for other rooms had Amazon included multi room music sync.By the time Amazon offered music sync between units word was out that Gen 2 was on its way so we waited. In Dec 2017 we ordered 3 more Echo's, two for the house as gifts for each other and one as a gift for a neighbor. Come Chrismas we were excited to get our new 2nd gen Echo's up and running. It was quite simple to do so and after setting up the Everywhere group via the Alexa app we had 3 rooms playing the same music, now we could have the music through out the house with out it blasting in any one room...nice. The new Echo's were a lot less expensive, even then our refreb Gen 1 Echo, They are a bit shorter and we opted for the grey fabric wrapped on the Gen 2. While I do miss the Gen 1 volume control where you counld just spin the Echo's top left or right to adjust the volume I find the Gen 2 to have the same fidelity with maybe a touch more base. All other features seem equal with the Gen 1 as Amazon keeps updating (automatically over the air) features to the entire line of Amazon Alexa devices. We have now started integrating \"Smart Home\" devices. We started with a couple of the TP plugs Amazon was providing at a greatly reduced price with the Echo purchases in Dec 2017, then I found the Sonoff WiFi switches that can be hardwired into circuits. Now our electric fireplace has a Sonoff inline and we can just say \"Alexa fire place on\" and the lighting system of the fireplace comes on or off when we tell it to. I've also hard wired Sonoff' switches to some of the exterior lighting circuits to control them either with Alexa or the app's timer feature and finally added one to the attic lights where the switch was practically inaccessible, now I just say \"Alexa turn on (off) attic lights\" before I enter the attic and I'm no longer stumbling through the pitch black attic looking for the switch. These Sonoff devices are less than $8 each! Its cheaper to use the Sonoff WiFi switches than the cost just in parts and wire to run a new light switch! Home automation is not coming, its here with devices such as the Echo and Sonoff that are scalable, easy to set up, easy to use, work well and are affordable for the average American. Thank you AMAZON for bringing home automation to our home. CON's: Wish Echo's could be grouped on more than one group. Be sure to indicate any Alexa device your buying from Amazon AS A GIFT if your giving it away, otherwise Amazon sets the device to be on your Alexa network and the gift recipient will end up with your Alexa options and info such as your shopping lists ect until deleted from your account.",

I am not a super-tech-savvy guy, but I had it set up and playing music within 20 minutes of it being delivered to my home. I used my iPad to \"install\" it (after getting the free Alexa app), and that was it. No problems. Sound is fantastic, and even though I bought it mainly for the music, I can see me using it to ask about the weather, how far it is to the nearest Domino's pizza, and how late does my local grocery stay open. If you like to listen to music and ask general questions, this is fantastic. If you are really interested, you can do all kinds of other stuff with it. I think I will keep it simple.

            "review_text": "--------------------------- UPDATE 11/4/2017 --------------------------- After all the negative reviews and feedback on the poor sound quality of the 2nd generation Echo it appears that Amazon has taken quick steps to help remedy the issue. I spoke with an Amazon representative on the phone who confirmed that there has been a software update which is rolling out to Echo devices. After getting the update my Echo does indeed sound better! I still wouldn't call it audiophile-quality by any means, but the bass is fuller and the sound is less \"tinny\" overall. To check which software version you have, select \"Settings\" on your Alexa phone app, choose your Echo device, then scroll down the page to where it says \"Device software version.\" The updated version (as of 11/4/17) is 592452420 (previously it was 592452320). You don't have to do anything to get the update; it will be sent automatically by Amazon. You may see the indicator light on your Echo will pulse blue as the update is installed. The representative I spoke with said you may get it more quickly by not using your Echo for several hours. I hit the mute button on mine and received the update within a few hours. I'm very impressed by Amazon's quick response to this issue! ----------------------------- ORIGINAL REVIEW ----------------------------- As a very happy owner of three Echo Dots (2nd generation) I was glad to see Amazon release a 2nd generation of the Echo as well. After using it for several days I can say I'm quite pleased with it, and even though it doesn't have any radical new features compared with the 1st Generation Echo or the Echo Dot, there are some notable improvements. I'll summarize these differences first and then describe the new Echo in a bit more detail. Improvements over the Echo 1st Generation: - More color and texture choices - A swappable outer shell - Ability to output audio to another device or stereo system via Bluetooth or an auxiliary cable - Dolby-powered speakers - Significantly lower price! Differences from the Echo Dot (2nd gen): - Larger size and swappable outer shell (these are probably obvious) - 2 speakers (tweeter and woofer) vs. 1 - Power adapter sits flatter against the wall --------------------------- Overall appearance --------------------------- I purchased the \"Heather Gray Fabric\" version. The cloth is a polyester woven fabric made up of lighter and darker shades of gray which certainly gives it more visual interest than if it were just a solid, uniform gray. The neutral color blends in with nearly any decor, and the cloth gives it a softer look which is great for areas of your house where you don't want something that screams \"I'm a device!\" In terms of size, the Echo 2nd Generation is almost the same diameter (3.5\") as the 1st Generation Echo (3.3\"), but it is several inches shorter. To me the original Echo looked like a tower; this shorter version is much less ostentatious. The top of the device is identical to the 2nd Gen Echo Dot: it has four buttons (volume up, volume down, microphone off, and an \"action\" button), a multi-colored light ring around the edge that tells you about the Echo's status, and seven tiny holes below which the microphones sit. A new feature of this Echo is its swappable decorative shell. Simply press a button on the underside of the device and the shell slides right off, allowing you to replace it with any of the other shells that Amazon sells. I'm not sure how many people will take advantage of this feature given that additional shells are $20-30, but it could be useful if you want to change your Echo's look to match a different location in your home. A final note on appearance: the power adapter for the Echo sits fairly flat against the wall, protruding maybe 1.5\". By contrast, the Dot's adapter sticks out from the wall 2-3 inches. The flatter adapter of the Echo is nice if you want to plug it into an outlet that is behind a piece of furniture. -------------------- Audio quality -------------------- I did a side-by-side comparison of the 1st and 2nd Generation Echos, and despite the new Dolby-powered speakers I did not notice a significant difference in sound quality with either music or spoken text. I certainly wouldn't call it \"room filling sound\" in any case. Clarity isn't bad, but bass is nearly non-existent. However, the real potential improvement in sound quality comes not from the speakers themselves but from a new feature for 2nd Generation Echo devices: using Bluetooth or a 3.5mm auxiliary cable (not included), you can play the audio through a nearby speaker or stereo system. Yes, this does means you are using two devices to accomplish one thing, but in a sense it's no different than plugging any other sound source into your stereo system. To be honest, I don't generally think of the Echo primarily as a music playback device anyway other than for very casual listening (but I realize that puts me in a minority... admittedly I'm a bit of an audiophile). Compared with the Echo Dot, however, there IS a noticeable difference in sound. This shouldn't be a surprise given that the Echo has two speakers (a tweeter and a woofer) while the Dot has only one. To my ear the difference isn't so much in clarity but rather in fullness. With two speakers and a bit more acoustic \"heft,\" the Echo's sound has more presence than the Dot's, which to me makes it more tolerable to listen to for a period of time. The difference is even more appreciable with music than with newscasts or other spoken text. ------------------------- Voice recognition ------------------------- This is one area where I must confess I'm disappointed. Like the 2nd Generation of the Dot, the Echo 2nd Generation uses seven microphones beneath its top surface to recognize voice commands spoken from any direction. My wife and I both found this Echo to be slightly LESS proficient at detecting our voices and recognizing vocal commands than our Dots are. We did side-by-side comparisons of the Echo and the Dot in several locations around our house and the Dot was nearly always better at picking up our voices (and yes, we only had one plugged in at a time!). I'm not sure why this would be since both devices use similar technology, but the difference was pretty consistent. One possible explanation I can think of is this: Both devices have their microphone openings on their top surfaces, effectively pointing upward. Because the Echo is taller than the Dot, if you put both devices side by side and speak to them from several feet away, your voice will hit the Dot's microphones at a slightly more downward (i.e., direct) angle than the Echo's, which may help the Dot pick up your voice better. Obviously I'm only speculating here, but in support of this theory I have noticed that both devices have difficulty detecting my voice if I speak from below them (for example, if I'm sitting on the floor and the device is on a table). ------------------- Functionality ------------------- The bottom line is that overall functionality -- what the Echo 2nd generation \"does\" -- is nearly identical to the 1st generation Echo and the Dot. Keep in mind that the Alexa assistant software on which all Echos operate is run on Amazon's cloud, not your individual device. This means that as Amazon adds features to Alexa they automatically become available on all Echo devices. So, you can use any of them to: - Stream music via WiFi from multiple sources - Control smart home devices - Make hands-free calls to other Echo devices or phone numbers in North America - Make purchases from your Amazon Prime account - Listen to news feeds, podcasts, etc. - Do anything else in Alexa's ever-growing skill set, such as make shopping lists, set timers/alarms/reminders, play games, tell you your daily schedule, and any other skills Amazon dreams up for Alexa in the future. Personally I have two favorite Alexa skills: the Flash Briefing and the drop-in feature. The flash briefing is fully customizable daily \"digest\" of news and other information which you can hear any time by asking \"What's my flash briefing?\" There is a huge list of content you can add to your briefing including news updates, weather forecasts, sports and traffic updates, and educational snippets along with many that are just humorous or entertaining. Using the Alexa phone app or your Echo account page you can select exactly what content you want in your briefing and in what order you want to hear it. For example, I configured mine with NPR news, BBC news, the weather, and a word of the day. I love having an on-demand synopsis of the latest news from my favorite sources. My other favorite feature, \"drop in,\" essentially opens a two-way communication channel between any two Echo devices, sort of like an intercom. Simply ask Alexa to \"drop in on [the living room, the kitchen...]\" and you are instantly connected. My wife and I use this feature all the time when we need to communicate from opposite ends of the house. You can turn drop-in capability on or off for each of your Echo devices individually, and you can also choose whether each device can drop in with ANY Echo device or only those in your own home. [Note that the drop-in feature is NOT the same thing as Alexa's hands-free calling feature. Hands-free calling allows you to call most phone numbers and Echo devices in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada from your Echo by saying your contact's name or number. Just like with a phone call, the other person must choose to answer your call before you can communicate. By contrast, with the drop-in feature communication is instantly established. For this reason you will probably want to use drop-in only with your closest family and friends, and probably only for certain rooms in your home!] ----------------------------------- A few (minor) complaints ----------------------------------- Unfortunately the Echo 2nd Gen shares an annoying trait of the Echo Dot: widely varying volume levels within the daily Flash Briefing. As you listen to the briefing, some components (such as One America News) come through quietly while others (like Fox News) are much louder. I don't know whether this variability is due to differences in how each component of the feed is produced or whether it has to do with the device itself, but in any case I hoped the phenomenon would be less pronounced with the 2nd Generation Echo than it is with the Dot. Unfortunately, it is not. Just be prepared to adjust the volume at the beginning of each segment. Another complaint I have is the inability to listen to certain feeds outside of the Flash Briefing. One America News is an example here: you can listen to the channel's live feed any time, but you can only hear the channel's \"top stories summary\" as part of your Flash Briefing. This issue is probably more software than device related, but still, it bugs me. -------------- A few tips -------------- 1) The Echo seems to pick up voices best when placed at or below eye level (i.e., roughly the level from which your voice emits). Mine has trouble detecting voices coming from below it, so I don't recommend placing this on a high shelf. 2) When you select news feeds for your Flash briefing I recommend picking one U.S. source and one international source (I use NPR and BBC - both are excellent). If you add too many feeds you'll get a lot of overlap and hear the same story several times. 3) If you have multiple Echo devices in your home, sometimes speaking to one will cause others to respond as well, especially if they are in close proximity (like in adjacent rooms). One way to prevent this is to change the wake word of one of the devices to \"Echo\" or \"Amazon.\" The only downside is that you then have to remember which wake word you assigned to each device! 4) Some speakers have a bit of a \"burn-in\" period, so in an attempt to improve my Echo's sound I left it playing music for much of the first few days I had it. The sound did seem to improve a LITTLE, (the lower frequencies filled in some), but it's still not stellar. But if you're not happy with the sound at first, let it play frequently for a few days and it may improve a bit. -------------------------- Which one to buy? -------------------------- If you are trying to decide between the Echo and the Dot, think carefully about how you plan to use the device. The single biggest practical difference between the two is that the Echo has fuller, better quality sound. So if you plan to use the device mostly for listening to music, news, podcasts, or whatever, you will probably appreciate the Echo's better acoustics. On the other hand, if you want to use it mainly for voice control of smart home devices, the Dot is more than sufficient. I have a Dot in our home theater room that I use exclusively to control the lights in that room. For that type of single-purpose application anything more than a Dot would be overkill. ========== Bottom line ========== Although the Echo 2nd generation may not have any earth-shattering new features compared with the 1st generation, its significantly lower price and ability to send music to another speaker or stereo system make it a winner. If you already own a 1st generation Echo there probably isn't a compelling reason to upgrade because the difference in sound quality isn't significant. But if this is your first Echo device you will probably be very pleased with it. And if you are deciding between the Echo and the Dot, which one you purchase comes down to how you want to use the device. For heavy listening, the Echo may be preferable for its better acoustics; otherwise, the Dot is a great deal -- especially at half the price of the Echo!",

            "review_text": "We\u2019re pretty fully into the Amazon Echo\u2019s. We\u2019ve got two bigger echos and three dots. This was bought to replace a dot, and I have to say I\u2019m impressed. First off it looks so much nicer than the original. Before the echo was very sterile looking. Now it looks much more classy and inviting. Almost like it belongs in the home / matches the decor\u00e8 much more seemlessly. The fabric is very welcoming and appreciated. The size is more manageable, too. We played the same song on both the new and old speakers. While it\u2019s not something that is going to blow you away, it is pretty significantly clearer, vocals are cleaner, and bass is more full. The sound was good enough for us to replace the one in the kitchen and move that one in the old dot location. It also has a coax connection for other sources as well. This is not something the original had, so that\u2019s a nice touch (even though most manufacturers are steering away from coax) The bad? I liked the volume ring that you could turn. I know it\u2019s one of those things that cost extra, and you can use your voice and the volume buttons, but I still enjoyed having the ring.",

I decided that for Christmas and my birthday (just a few short weeks after Christmas) I was going to get one. Instead of searching my wish list for the Echo I had added long ago, I decided to just search for it. And so glad I did, because the 2nd gen popped up, and at a smaller price point at that (I did pick up when on discount for holiday after all). I anxiously awaited the delivery, which happened to be a day earlier that what I was told it would be, and I immediately tore into the package as soon as it arrived. I have been loving it. I use it to set up a backup alarm to wake up to, I get my news flashes from Alexa, Ive played trivia with Alexa, and she is great at helping find just the right music to listen to. Oh, and did I mention, she can control my Fire TV as well!! I have loved it so much, I decided to look into the Echo dot to put throughout the house, especially the kids room so that I don't have to leave my phone in there playing music till they fall asleep when over at my house. So the New Year comes and goes, and I decide that I was pretty good the previous year, and my birthday was in just a couple weeks, I went ahead and bought 2 Echo dots to go with it. The only regret so far is that my 5 year old daughter won't quit asking Alexa to tell her jokes lol. I highly recommend. It has great sound, Alexa is awesome, and the new and improved design makes it great in any decor.",

            "review_text": "Little or no FM radio reception here. Yes I have a collection of Bluetooth speakers but the music selection and the multiple steps to connect and control audio via phone/tablet/PC are a PITA. For years, I was concerned about evesdropping and ignored the Echo phenomena. That said, in a moment of weakness I ordered a Dot and my world changed. I use it in my study with and without paired Bluetooth speakers and I do not have to lift a finger to switch between the output or play anything from SiruisXM to radio stations to digital music collections and more. The very next day I ordered an Echo 2. The living area is another situation. Sure I can pair my phone/tablet to the high-end Sony soundbar to rock the house but yet again, it required multiple steps to do so and control it. Since the SO is mortified by any kind of unapproved music forced upon her, I decided to emply an Echo 2 so that I can quickly start, stop and control radio and unlimited music selections with as little drama as possible from the breakfast table. I can now blabber to Alexa in any tone of voice in order to get the job done. Plus, both the Dot and Echo 2 have hearing that is far better than mine. She responds without error from across a large living area even when music is playing. Damn the reviews but the sound quality is plenty good enough and you can easily connect it to other speakers if you want to host a house or pool party. Dot aside, I really do not understand all the griping about sound quality. I was delighted that the Echo 2 has enough fidelity and volume to satisfy me and annoy the SO. The Echo product family is supremely engineered and one of the best products that I have ever purchased--and there have been too many to count. Disclosure: After Dot, I uploaded my entire digital music collection to Amazon Music. While it is comparably under-featured when compared to other mobile players, it works very well with the Echo products and I can listen to my collection sans zero drama and effort. UPDATE: After nearly a week of listening, it is true that the lower mid-range of some types of music and individual tracks are muddled and Alexa's voice and voice output in general is a tad loud with too much bass. However, I am confident that an update will eventually smooth everything out. That said, I wish equalization was available in the Alexa app in order to tailor the sound for the environment and the type of music. I also found that speaker placement is critical. At first I had it 8\" from the wallls in a corner which caused the bass to boom. I moved it in front of a flat wall and it sounded better. I think that the further away from walls the better in order to accomodate the 360-degree sound. I think that ultimately it would sound the best in a middle of a room but who has power outlets located there (a kitchen island comes to mind)? Finally, I would like auto sound levelling because when my daily briefing switches from staid and bassy NPR to noisy Reuters TV, the volume jumps condsiderably. Nevertheless, I still LOVE this well-designed piece of kit but note that I use it like a radio at mostly lower volumes. Thanks Amaon for bringing back a hands-free radio+ experience for somebody that gets minimal radio reception.",

I do wish I could change the bass in it as some songs can be a bit strong (Migraine sufferer here). But, I haven't taken the time to research that yet. PROS: It plays music for up to 6 hours (timer setting), this is also a con, if you don't have an 8-10 hour playlist and you're just listening to a station. Alexa will read your Kindle books to you. I no longer have to have a battery operated radio to play music for the dog when I'm gone during the day. (yes, he's a baby, and it helps calm him). You can set reminders (helpful in our household). CONS: The updates seem to hit when I need it to play music. Not sure if there's a setting for that either. The sound when it plays your audible book vs your music is lower for audible (so if you stop playing your audible book, and then the next time you use that speaker for music, it's super loud). The timers are softer sounding than I would like, and I do have it turned up (music plays louder than the timer).",

            "review_text": "I just bought this new model for a room which belonged to my late wife and which has not been used for almost 3 years. It is quite remote from the rest of the house, so it deserves it's own Echo. This is my 6th Echo in a 2,400 sq ft (2 floor) house. I bought the original Echo two years ago then added 4 Dots to that and now this handsome new Echo. They all function independently and together (music everywhere !! ... without latency issues). I probably use all of them for \"smart home\" control (more commands than any other type) of 9 WeMo switches, a Nest thermostat, and a NEXX garage door controller. I now live alone and it is an extra feeling of security to be able to turn on lights in the house when arriving home after dark. I have an extra loud doorbell (not WiFi controlled) which I wouldn't be able to hear in this newly remodeled room under any circumstances...so my next smart home addition will likely be a WiFi (Alexa controlled) doorbell (incl. video camera). My Dots all have accompanying JBL Bluetooth speakers (however, they're hard wired due to the limitation on Bluetooth in a shared network, i.e. \"music everywhere\" only works if speakers are internal or hard wired). I don't find this to be a big deal. I'm glad that they are Bluetooth speakers for travel purposes, but that is not necessary on a day to day basis. However, I really like the sound of this new unit...it may be just a touch better than the original \"large\" Echo (both are superb for the intended purpose). In this new office and for casual listening the internal speaker is plenty good. If I \"require\" serious listening, I can play the sound through my media system or high-end stereo speakers if necessary. I also use Alexa for information, stock market reports, flash briefings, frequently for time information when I can't see a clock, and for weather reports. All of my married children have Dots (which I gave them for Christmas in 2016), so we're going to be working on setting up telephonic connections very soon. For me Alexa is a voice in an otherwise silent house...a side benefit. Over these past two years she has acquired many skills, but I'm not sure she's any smarter with regard to interpreting my statements to her or wishes of her. BUT what I do appreciate is that for tasks she performs I don't have to memorize a script to use her. She responds to natural speech well enough to control all those things I wish to control.",

I asked questions, read reviews, etc. They seemed to have very similar reviews so I bought the Alexa when it was on sale. Initially it was fun and exciting but after having it for several months I am not impressed at all. It is definitely not even as useful as the Google Assistant on my phone. I use that far more than the Alexa. Everyone said, the more you use it, the more it learns, so we really tried doing that and it did not make a difference. It constantly didn't know or doesn't understand, even basic stuff. It can't come up with answers from a basic Google search. It sometimes recites from Wikipedia, but other times can't, which makes no sense. It's become an expensive timer we use once a day at bedtime. It really is very unimpressive and a huge let down. It will also randomly speak up when no one says anything to it, or even when there isn't any noise. It once woke us up answering something no one asked. Visited my sister, who got the Google home, and it worked so much better. It was even better than the assistant on my phone. Would NOT recommend. If you want something like this, go for the Google Home. Regret buying. Wish I could return it but we didn't realize it was basically useless until after the return period was over bcs I bought it as a family Christmas present so we didn't use it right away. Update: I received great customer service based off of this review from Tim B. He helped in every way he could. Unfortunately the Alexa still couldn't do what I wanted and continued to malfunction. He seemed genuinely surprised by some of the things, so it may have been a dud. However, I was specifically told it can not do Google searches by an Amazon employee. So all the ppl answering questions saying that it can do everything a Google home can, according to Amazon, are incorrect. The skills (apps for it basically) often worked very poorly. It was shocking how poorly some worked and nothing was ever changed even though the reviews on the skill were all bad. I don't recommend purchasing this item still. I do appreciate the great customer service I received from Tim. Though for some reason, other employees have called me about this review, in fact I was called by 3 separate employees today, which is insane, considering I actually told one they have to stop calling and then got called again! My opinion of the product has not changed and I will not change my review and lie. Tim was incredibly helpful and I really appreciated his help. I would also appreciate it if other employees stopped calling me in what appears to be an attempt to get me to change my review. Well I guess it worked, but probably not what they wanted. If I continue to be badgered about this review I will update it again listing exactly what it did, and I'm certain they don't want that.",

So if I have a speaker in my study and sometimes I want to the music shared there sometimes, but not always, I can\u2019t do that. I also have not yet found an Alexa command that let\u2019s me take existing music and just add a speaker to it, or expand it to a larger area (i.e. \u201cAlexa, play this music in the study too\u201d or \u201cAlexa, play this music in the downstairs group\u201d) - instead you have to restart the music you\u2019re listening to (i.e. \u201cAlexa, shuffle Bob Seger songs downstairs\u201d). \u2018 * The speaker quality in this is pretty high quality. I\u2019ve gone through probably a dozen Bluetooth speakers, some of them quite expensive, and I think I\u2019ve only heard one (JBL) that was higher quality.

Now the sound is so good I'm wondering how Amazon stuffed such a big sound in such a small package. I honestly dropped my jaw today when a fairly bass intensive song came on and my Echo tackled it like a much larger sound system. This is a very worthy successor to the first gen Echo. If you were on the fence about whether or not to get this device: Go for it. You won't regret it. (Old Review) I bought this as an upgrade to the Echo Dot which I had for nearly a year, but didn't like the sound it produced. The sound this new Echo produces is much better than the Dot, but nowhere near the sound of the Gen 1 (which I have heard via display units many times). I get the distinct impression that a large reason the sound isn't that good is due to the EQ settings for the speaker. If Amazon can give us control over the EQ in the Alexa app, I think customers could fix a lot of the issues themselves. This Echo also has a few mild glitches at times. The light-ring stutters a bit at times, the unit may be slow to respond to commands, and sometimes a weird pop sound comes from the speaker before/after Alexa talks, usually when asking Alexa to handle an app like Spotify. Of course the unit is brand new so there are bound to be patches. I'm not sending mine back unless Amazon says this first run is defective. It has potential, but it needs improvements. Update: I think my Echo just received an update because the light bar was spinning (though I didn't hear Alexa say anything) and now it sounds like my Echo has some more bass.When I put my hand on the desk next to the Echo while playing music I can feel some vibration. There was nothing before the update. Music is also noticeably more well rounded. Could use a smidge more tweaking, but it is better. Amazon is listening and it's working on our issues.

It just goes to show you have to know what you want from a device like this. Although the voice assistant isn't as good as google, I have experience with amazon hardware versus google hardware. Amazon is usually rock solid stable, versus google's perpetual beta system. Google also has a tendency to kill things, and while I wouldn't put that past Amazon, its highly unlikely that they will kill off Alexa. Amazon also innovates a lot quicker than Google (and others) when it comes to these things. They invented this space after all. How long will it take others just to come out with a buggy video version, and amazon already has about 3 producs with it (spot, echo look, and echo show). Either way, if you're home automation focused, I'd go amazon because it has more support and is probably going to come out with more innovative ideas.

My wife took some time to warm up to her and thought she was \"creepy\" at first, but now she's asking her questions. Last night we were watching TV and a question came up and rather than reach for my iPhone I simply asked Alexa and she had the answer immediately. At a family reunion this Summer my younger cousins were sitting around the Echo playing 20 questions when I came in and said \"Alexa, turn on the kitchen lights!\" and she replied \"OK!\" . . . you would have thought Jesus had just arrived to the party! My cousins started shouting commands to Alexa to figure out what other things I had taught her . . . Lots of fun and super handy when you have your hands full and need a light turned on!",

I could hear this over all of my apartment and stopped increasing the sound level only because I felt the neighbors would be able to hear it and complain (although they are not normally complainers). I just did not believe the sound could actually be this good. I have only had this one day so cannot attest to its longevity. But I am sorry that I waited so long to get one of these. I highly recommend this product! Of course, I am still learning all of the other things this unit can do but have been very satisfied so far.

So, I bought an Echo for my bedroom because I didn't have any good speakers there and thought I would get decent sound from it and it would be an easy way to listen to music in that room. It's been frustrating so far. The sound is not as good as what I anticipated. It's muddy and not much better than my TV speakers, which isn't saying much. Also, it seems to have difficulty finding what I ask it to play, whether that's on Amazon Prime Music or Spotify. It keeps telling me it can't do that on Spotify, which is promoted as a music service recognized by Alexa. When using Amazon Prime,it just has trouble coming up with the right playlist. I understand there is a software update that may fix the sound problem and hopefully continued use will get Alexa more accustomed to my voice and result in better searches. The biggest problem, since it is located on my nightstand, is the light ring is constantly on. it's not because I'm interacting with it so it must be interacting with the TV. That's a real problem when my wife is trying to go to sleep and the ring is lit keeping her awake. I end up having to unplug it every night, which is a bit of a pain and certainly not what was intended in its operation. If we can fix this problem, then we can bump up the stars by one.",

Although I use Sonos for home audio, I can still use this to play music in one room, or play the same song at every location I have an Echo device. I've tested Echo against the Google Home and Siri products, and IMO, Amazon beats them in just about every way. The Apple Homepod does put out good sound, but Sonos beats them hands down. And since I can control Sonos from Echo, I'll stay in the Echo ecosystem for AI. I would recommend this to friends and family, hands down. Well done, Amazon.

The new Echo is not as responsive to requests as the Dot. The Dot would switch lights on and off fairly quickly. The Echo has to think about the request for quite a while before it responds, sometimes to the point of giving up just as the light finally switches, and seems to miss more requests than the Dot.

There are some things where you won't quite get an answer to a question you could google. But, sometimes we'll ask Alexa a quick question anyways, especially it we have our phones in another room or are cooking and need to be hands free, and be surprised with a helpful answer. The sound is amazing for music. We would rather play music off the Echo than our tv. We have problems connecting to spotify by voice but we can manually connect to the spotify app and play music via bluetooth. (That's where playlists I've made are, and sometimes want to mix it up, as Amazon music mostly plays either a specific artist, or a specific genre + time period) There is rarely a problem for us to wake the Echo, even while it's playing loud music. We often have problems waking our first generation Dot, especially when the alarm is going off in the morning. We'll be practically shouting at it to get it to stop ringing. I can see us replacing the Dot with an Echo soon and purchasing a few more Alexa products. If not for us, then for our friends and family. Whenever we are away from home, we'll find ourselves saying \"I miss Alexa\" when wanting to ask a quick question or play a specific song.

Alexa keeps my shopping list and I never have to find a note paper to write something down! She plays games with me and even does metric/Inch conversions! Handy if you are shopping online! There's too much to mention here, with new things added all the time! I have a Dot upstairs in my bedroom, but my big Echo is downstairs. I love making and answering phone calls with Alexa. I love the light colored, fabric covered one; blends right into my decor. It was about half the price of the earlier Echos, and the Dolby sound is awesome! Totally love my Echo and Dot!",

I will be adding wall switches as well as a thermostat down the road. The ease of setup was astounding and finding a central location in a 2 story house was tough. I chose the living room because the sound quality is superb and could not believe the music coming out of the device. Now my wife can turn on her bedside lamp before going upstairs and the lamp by her chair in the living room. I also have an outlet in the kitchen for a fan to help circulate air. THE main incecntive to purchase was the $20 discount and got a great deal on the outlets. I know I will have to purchase another Echo or Echo and place upstairs.",

First of all the sound is very loud, surprisingly so actually, but at max volume there is quite a bit of distortion so I would recommend keeping it a notch or so below max. Second, the bass is very nice for some songs, but for others its incredibly overdone and lacking in the mids/highs. Alexa is fairly responsive and so far responds correctly to most commands. It supports multiple music platforms such as Pandora, Prime Music Unlimited and others, but notably absent is support for Apple music. You can work around this by using the it as a bluetooth speaker, but that takes a big part of the functionality away so this is a workaround at best. It was very easy to setup, even for someone who may not be very technical. The third party \"skills\" have a lot to be desired in my opinion, most are so full of ads they are unusable, Id like to see this improved. I'd rather see the option to pay a few bucks to \"buy\" the skill vs a subscription or tons of ads even if they are just ads for their own product.",

For years we've been using a boombox (from the 90s) since our cell phones were not good enough to use as a radio in our house. We saw Alexa as a way to have music in the house, which she does, but she does so much more too. My favorite functions are playing music, setting a timer, adding things to my shopping list, and calling my kids at home through Alexa. I had no idea when I bought it that my husband would take to it so well. We were all stuck listening to David Bowe at high volumes for a few days after it arrived. :) The one we got is charcoal gray, and while it is not an object d'art, it is really useful and not offensive to my decor. I can easily move it from one room to another without losing settings or anything if I need to. I'm considering getting an additional dot for another part of the house. It was easy to set up. I'm ok with technology, but really it only took me like, 10 minutes to set everything up, so it is not hard. I was at a furniture store the other day when my kids called me through Alexa. Our furniture store associate thought that was so cool he had me help him connect to his Echo so he could call his kid and it took about 1 minute to set up. I do find the calling to be echo-y though--it's not crystal clear sound for the calling in my experience. I had read some of the reviews about the music speaker sound not being that great, and I found that it is perfectly fine for our family. I love that I can play pandora and I heart radio on it. One thing I wish it could do is play library-rented audio books. It will only play audio books from audible currently. You can have Alexa read books to you but I find that her automated voice is really annoying for book reading--inflections are all wrong. So, it is not perfected, but it is a great purchase none the less.",

I can easily hear it even outside of the bedroom in another room. Whether the volume is low or high, the sound quality is not compromised and the bass is excellent. It's much better than playing music from my smart TV, laptop or phone. I also like telling Alexa what genre to play and letting her do the work to decide what song comes next. She keeps streaming great songs, some I haven't heard in a long time and had forgotten about. I also use it for an alarm in the morning. I will try out the reminders and other features in the future. I am still figuring out how to sync it with my phone's bluetooth so I can stream Youtube sometimes. My only complaint is it started talking in the middle of the night last night when I had already put it on 'do not disturb' mode. It scared me right out of the bed! Hope that doesn't keep happening. I am happy with it overall and excited to see what else it can do. But even if you are only using it for music - it's excellent.

Also I would like to note that my two youngest have begun to speak much more clearly, the peer pressure of getting snickered at because you aren't understood does wonders and we are a loving family so there are no bad feelings just rueful exasperation from the mush-mouthed questioner. I will say I wish Alexa interacted better with manners, it might sound ridiculous to some people but manners matter and it's a social habit that should be maintained at all times. The sound quality is really good, though I wish for better bass.. a future add on feature perhaps? I am a little sad the wake word is so limited, I would like to name this new family member like I did the others both kids and fur-kids. I also wish the timer sounds were different, they blend into a busy household - last I checked between the alarm and timer sounds one was customizable and the other was not and yes this makes a big difference when using Alexa on the fly.

The design is small and compact that it fits better anywhere you place it. I was worried that the sound quality would be bad since it is so much smaller, but the volume is really loud at max and it has more bass then the original. I'm really impressed with the built-in Mic, it now has 7 mic built-in pointing in all direction of the speaker. It can hear me much further and understand me much better now. I also bought a smart power strip with this and plug in many of my electronic devices and it has made my life a lot better and I feel like living in the future. I can now just say \"Alexa turn TV On\" \"Alexa Turn Printer On.\" I can also use it as a blue tooth speaker to play my music when I go to sleep.

I think the only major downside is that I live in a rural area, so some of Alexa's skills like Uber and Dominos are not something I can use to my advantage. One of my wife and I's favorite features is the 'drop in' ability. As long as you have wifi and are using the Alexa App, you can drop in from anywhere. It's so nice to not have to wait to dial one of our cell phones if we know one of us is home. One of the only other things I'll mention in the way of a complaint, is that sometimes you have to be over specific when making a music request. Alexa doesn't default to my purchased music library, but it could be a setting I'm missing. In the end, we'll be planning on getting at least one more Echo and a Show.

I get the weather, the traffic, trivia, jokes, reminders (omg, how did I live without the reminders?), and no more both of you staring blankly because neither can remember the important thing we needed which is not on the grocery or shopping lists. I threw over our Google overlords for Alexa. Abooboo is our new leader, and we welcome her domination! However, Abooboo is not for the feint of heart, as she comes with little or no instructions. I had to google (ironic, right?) how to do things. Why can't I just ask her how to set up this feature or that? She says she doesn't know. I realize the days of instruction manuals are gone, but this gadget really needs one. More than once when working things out I almost threw her back in the box to Amazon. Heads up, guys. Not everyone out there wants to be wedded to their computer to figure out a product. Give us a freakin' booklet! Now if you will excuse me, Abooboo has just informed me I have to call my Dad. ;-)",

To make this review easy and to the point i have listed it's core aspects below and i'll say what i like about them and what i don't like about them. 1. Design - The design of this device is quite stylish. It sports a black leather casing that can be swapped out at any time for a new case. If it happens to get dirty, just put a new one on and it's like new again! 2. Sound - With this being a speaker, you can't review it without talking about its sound quality. The sound quality on this is quite excellent for it's size and is able to be quite loud in a decent sized room. The highs are crisp and the bass is enough to make my desk rattle. 3. Alexa - Alexa works okay on here. However, there are times (more often then not) where she can't hear me and i have to talk pretty loud. Other times, she do a command that is the exact opposite of what i wanted her to do in the first place. This happens all the time and gets pretty annoying to the point where i just stop using it for a while.

When it does understand a single request like turn on the lights or play XY song, you have to say it very slowly to the point when it's annoying. Then there is finding Spanish music, just as much as a pain if you're using Amazon unlimited music, but there are other streaming sites to use that are better. It also does not help that the Alexa AI isn't optimized for the different types of Spanish. The way a central American speaks Spanish has some differences from how Mexicans or Spaniards speak it. Of course there isn't a huge difference but you will run into those problems on occasion. It is a good little speaker and it works great when using it on English instead of Spanish. But I bought this product instead of the Google home because I was told that the echo now fully supported Spanish which made it more tempting after considering that amazon Alexa's work more flawlessly than the Google homes for ever day task. In the end that was just a sales pitch and the Spanish mode is not on the level it should be for every day family use. Just a heads up; you also need to have a subscription for Amazon music unlimited (not included with prime), Spotify premium, or one of the other stated music streaming sites to actually use the echo to it's full potential. There are still people out there who don't pay to stream music, but rather own the music instead, and they should know before buying.",

We\u2019ve also enabled quite a few additional skills over the last 2+ months. About the time that we started listening to music on our Dot, we decided that we liked the idea and were having fun with Alexa, enough that it would be worth it to purchase another device so we could have one on each of the upper 2 floors of our house. We purchased the Echo (sandstone fabric) in early January. The first thing we noticed is that the sound quality with music on the Echo is significantly better than the Dot. We\u2019ve had no issues with either device not registering our commands, in fact, both devices routinely pick up our commands from one room away. That said, our house is fairly quiet, not much competing noise. These days, in addition to the smart home skills, we frequently stream a local radio station or Pandora on our Echo and find the sound quite acceptable! We\u2019re not musicians but we do enjoy having music on, in the background, throughout the day.

Some of its features it seems you have to ask the question in just the right way to work (this seems more so with prime music). However I am very happy with the product! We use it as a sort of intercom to call our kids in the basement.",

To give some context I was raised in the midwest and have virtually no accent, and a very clear and loud voice, however sometimes Alexa has difficulty understanding or hearing my voice. This isnt a constant issue, but still an occasional nuisance. Amazon music also isnt free, even if you already have Amazon prime, ALOT of music is included with Amazon Prime, but alot also isnt, which is disappointing considering it is the most convienient way to listen to specific music with Alex using voice commands. Overall, I would probably rate Alexa at 3.5 stars because I love talking to it and the convienience factor it offers, but it definitely could be better.",

The sound is above average until you go up to about 75-80% and then the bass diminishes. The sound is at its best around half way up or around 60% volume. Alexa doesn\u2019t get what I ask her but that could be my accent so I cannot blame her for that. The phone answer did not work for me while the music was playing so I returned the echo connect device. It basically answered the phone while it was playing the music so you and the person on the phone could hear the music and did not carry the conversation because of it. I still have not used a smart device with it so cannot comment on it. Overall I give this product a 4 stars for it\u2019s sound quality and the product looks and the material used to make it. Perhaps I should have purchased the Echo Plus, I don\u2019t know?

The issue son this one remain the same as the issues on the old versions: If you don't mind them it's a good product. - Problems recovering from whole home audio: If I play a song through this while connected to my soundbar in whole home audio, when it's done, it won't connect back to my soundbar again unless I do a hard reboot (unplug/plug it back in). - It randomly talks to itself. Occasionally in a completely quiet room, this or any of my others will randomly reply to unasked questions. It also can be triggered by noise from the TV other than the trigger word. - Although the unit closes to the speaker is supposed to activate on keyword, that isn't the case. I've had units 40' further away respond. When I called Amazon Tech support I was told that you fix this was to change the trigger words (which isn't a fix, it's a workaround). One of the reasons I replaced an old one with this was to see if that was fixed.... it wasn't. Overall I still \"like' the product and would probably \"love\" it if they fixed the quirks, but I'm not holding my breath.

Bravo, Amazon! Previous entry: delivered today, first Echo device to not work flawlessly. Briefly worked as intended, sounded great, but now doesnt appear on my list of devices in the app (this is my fifth one, so pls dont tell me how it should be set up) and is flashing a red light at me.

If you expect results like you would get with a google search, you will be very disappointed. A lot of times my wife and I are watching TV and we ask Alexa about an actor or actress, and many times we come up short and resort to google on our tablet. Adding skills can add to the functionality, but many of the skills are more for marketing purposes rather than providing useful functionality to you. There is a \"DeWalt Tools\" skill that will let you ask: \"Alexa, ask DeWalt Tools what is your history\"... I'd like to meet any person who would find this skill useful... just so I could ask \"WHY? Why would you enable such a useless skill?\" I can see Alexa being much more useful if you have smart devices in your home, such as a connected thermostat, roomba, garage door opener, etc. as asking Alexa to change the thermostat setting, or asking if the garage door is open, would be very useful. Using Alexa to add events to my google calendar is also not quite ready for prime-time. You would think this would be relatively easy, however, how Alexa and Google handle timezones creates a problem. (Alexa does not send timezone information with the request, so google assumes the time is GMT when storing the event, however, since google has my timezone set as PST - it converts the GMT time to PST when displaying it.) Personally - IMO Google has this correct, and Alexa should send my timezone with the request to create the event. After all, she knows my timezone. On the brighter side - Alexa does have an opinion - albeit clinical - to the question \"Alexa - does size really matter?\"",

It\u2019s important to note that you don\u2019t really need to have one Echo per room as the Echo Dots provide the same functionality as their big brother, however, in my case I wanted a louder speaker for each of the rooms with those devices. Connecting the Echo Dot to a higher end speaker is also always an option of course. As far as design goes, the second generation Echo look much more aesthetically appealing. As you can see from the photos, it\u2019s a little bit over half the height of the original. It\u2019s also a slightly bit thicker than the first generation but it\u2019s not really something you can catch with the eye, you have to stack them on top of each other to see the very minor increase in width. I included a photo of a can of soda next to the Echos as I think that\u2019s a good reference point for someone that has never seen the device up close. The new fabric design makes it less awkward to have in your living room, making it look less like a gadget and more like a complementary decoration. It\u2019s also fairly simple to remove the fabric sleeve and replace it with a difference color if you ever feel bored of staring at the same design. All you have to do is push on a round button at the base of the Echo and the sleeve starts coming right off. You can make voice commands through Alexa with both of these devices, but the second generation seems to be able to distinguish my voice better and from a farther distance. This is mainly due to the fact that this new iteration of the Echo has seven microphones on the top face whereas the older version has only one microphone. I was a little bit disappointed with the sound of this new iteration though. Personally, it seems to me that the sound seems louder on both of my First Generation Echos. It\u2019s still a great speaker though, loud and clear sound, so I wouldn\u2019t discourage anyone from purchasing this awesome device. I guess that I was just expecting to hear and notable improvement on the loudness of it. If you already own a first generation Echo I wouldn\u2019t advice you get rid of it just to upgrade to the second generation, unless your goal is to have a more modern design, but in terms of functionality it\u2019s almost the same thing. Overall if you don\u2019t already have an Echo device, I would highly recommend getting this one, it looks much better than the original and it\u2019s not as tall, better voice recognition, and the difference in sound is not much to be a problem, at least not for me. Note: I won both of the First Generation Echos I have at a raffle at my job, hence the reason it has \u201cShowtime\u201d printed on it, I\u2019m not in any way affiliated with them.

So I figured I'd go one better, and got the big one. Huge difference in sound quality! Super loud and crisp. So yeah, I use it all the time for music (Amazon Prime definitely worth it), and simple tasks like setting timers and alarms. It also controls my handy colored smart light bulb. My only little problem is that it doesn't work in my country for making phone calls. I talked to customer service and they said America only, which really makes no sense to me because its not like its using a SIM card or something. It's just using the contacts on my phone. So yeah, that's pretty stupid, but it's not a big deal to me really. Not enough to lose a star anyway hehe.",

If you are just starting to purchase Alexa devices I recommend purchasing the plus first then the 2nd generation for the bedrooms. We purchased an echo dot and speaker clock for our guest room. Only disappointment is that we cant link our amazon wireless speaker to our whole house music. They are adding stuff all the time so hopefully that will update in the near future. You can now use your devices as a whole house speaker system which we really enjoy. With a 5 bedroom house it makes it very convenient to speak to other family members in other parts of the house without having to yell or drop what you\u2019re doing to go across the house. It does take a bit of time to figure things out for the first time but if you have patience with yourself as you learn all that it offers you\u2019ll be glad you purchased.",

I decided to give the Echo a try anyway, and I received it on 12/28/17. It worked effortlessly for about 5 days...then I lost the wi-fi connection. Followed every instruction I could find to fix this, including contacting my internet service provided who assured me all was fine on their end. Since my other devices were working, I then called Customer Service, sent the Echo in for repair, got it back 4 days later and tried again. Same problem, so it was returned, and a brand new one was delivered immediately. When I connected that one, I had the same issue. I decided it was NOT an Echo problem and that it had to be a wi-if connection problem. Decided to order a new router with stronger capabilities and, as of today, the problem has been resolved. For those of you leaving 1 star reviews due to connectivity issues, I suggest you look a bit further to determine if a stronger router would take care of this issue for you as it did for me. And thank you, Amazon, for all you did to try and alleviate this problem when your product was not to blame at all.",

I take that back Apple Siri does understand you more than Alexa, but Alexa app controls smart home device better than Siri. Echo has a hard time trying to figure out where you are talking from when speaking to it, you have to repeat yourself over and over again before it gets it right, plus tell it to stop something it thought you said, it will start a song or read a book to me when I'm only asking it to turn on the lights or turn fan off.

Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't. This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out. My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step. My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done). However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence. When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name. I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.

The highs seem crisper and the lows a little richer. If you are an 'audiophile' you will surely be disappointed. But, for the other 99.9% of us, it is a decent speaker. My only real complaint about the Echos (and not just this model) is that the multi-speaker audio is really flakey in my experience. It's great when it works, but that is a capital 'W' when.",

            "review_text": "I visited my daughter last weekend and she had purchased an echo a week before. I always thought these things were silly and unnecessary. As I work in IT security I rolled my eyes at the idea of me installing a \"listening device\" in my house. Well, I played with it a couple hours and ordered a Dot. The next day I bought an Echo too. I'm a music lover and its music features alone are what sold me. Connected to a free Pandora and Prime account, I have lots of music at my fingertips. I'm branching into roots music and being new to it I constantly hear new songs. It is a good thing I don't get charged every time I say, \"Alexa, who is this?\" and \"Alexa, I like this\" which upvotes it in Pandora so it learns my tastes. And therein lies its beauty. I can be cooking, reading, cleaning, or anything you can imagine and interact with music services like I had a servant catering to my every desire. On a whim with just a few words. Without having to pick up a damn phone or fiddle with knobs. It isn't a high end, high power audio system. But I find the quality and volume more than adequate around the house. If I want it louder I can easily plug it in to my home audio system or plug/pair it with my bluetooth speaker...which was twice the price and wasn't anything but a speaker. As for the security concerns, I just go in the bathroom and turn on the exhaust fan and shower when I want to talk privately. JUST KIDDING!! Several things made me believe the features were worth the small risk (and EVERYTHING carries some risk): 1. I live alone so it doesn't have much to hear. But even if I didn't I don't think I'd be too concerned. 2. It isn't supposed to send anything to Amazon until activated by its attention word (Alexa by default). If it ever got out that it was sending sound before that, it might mark the end of the market for these devices. Well, maybe not, we're putting up with similar crap from phone OS and apps, ISP snooping, video surveillance everywhere, web site trackers, etc. 3. If it collected credit card numbers or medical information that might put all of Amazon or Google's home device infrastructure in scope for PCI or HIPAA compliance. Something they'd probably prefer to avoid. ;) Equifax and probably a dozen other companies already gave away my national password, er, SSN. But I digress. Like I said, its capabilities as a versatile, easy, hands free interface to music services is why I bought it (and its low price and wanting to have music more distributed around the house). All its other features are frosting on the cake. I'm not particularly interested in home automation but I'll probably tinker with it at some point. It might be useful to make and receive hands free phone calls if it can do that. Information lookup? Bleh. It isn't often I want a sound bite answer to anything. Voice purchases? Probably not. I'm likely to order repeat stuff while I'm online shopping for other stuff or looking at a menu. And tying voice actuation to a credit card attached account seems like an accident waiting to happen. Programming capabilities and routines? I'll have to see how powerful the API is. In the back of my mind I'm thinking of how it might be useful to tie it to my Karafun account and maybe FireTV if my PS3 ever dies. Or maybe tie it to local event web sites so I can say, \"Alexa, what's happening in town tonight?\". Maybe it can already do something like that. I don't know. I'm a newbie. BTW, I bought a second echo. I don't splurge often but having a music genie in another room for $79 was too hard to pass up. Why did I buy Amazon over Google? Price. Features. I think Google will eventually be better at information lookups because, well, they're google. But that feature is low priority for me.",

            "review_text": "Edit - Updates Comments on 11/21/2017: After my initial review (see below these updated comments) expressing my disappointment in the Echo 2.0 product and it's poor initial sound quality, to their credit, someone from Amazon actually phoned me and told me they acknowledged the problem and were issuing a software update to \"cure\" the problem. I was out of town and unable to actually use my Echo 2.0 that week, so I was curious to see how it sounded when I got back. It does indeed sound much better, and since then I believe a second software update was sent out. Due to this major improvement, I will be changing my rating from two stars to three. If they can improve the sound even more through further updates, or take some other action to further satisfy me, I'll consider raising it to four stars, but honestly, I'm still smarting from my initial experience right out of the box where my jaw dropped in horror at the sound quality. That was not an experience I'm likely to forget about anytime soon. Just yesterday I had time to actually listen to a few favorite songs on the unit. It definitely has more bass than before, and sounds vastly better than it did initially. That being said, and I noticed this from the beginning, there is split second \"crackle\" in the speaker when playing music ever minute or two. It's not a deal breaker most likely, but it's definitely disturbing and disappointing to hear this since it does happen frequently. I am not a perfectionist when it comes to audio, but I think my issue with this product, and I would guess many others, is that Amazon prominently mentioned \"improved sound\" when introducing Echo 2.0....and it's not. Regardless how \"acceptable\" the sound is now with the two software updates.....it is still NOT better than the original Echo 1.0, which I have had for 18 months and from the start thought has an amazingly rich sound quality. In case anyone from Amazon is reading this, the lesson I would take from this is, don't ever promise more than you can deliver. While I would have found the echo 2.0 lacking in the sound quality area regardless, what made me more disappointed, and yes, even a bit angry, is how you point blank advertised \"improved sound quality\", which is clearly is not.....so far anyway. If you can do further software updates or other methods to improve the sound....kudos to you, but either way, out of the box, you dropped the ball on this one. To be fair, Amazon has provided me with excellent service over the 7 years I've been dealing with them. I've had them go over the top in taking good care of me on more than a few occasions, and I want to acknowledge that up front. This is just one case where they definitely did not meet or exceed my expectations. Original review below: I am so disappointed! I have had one original echo (1st generarion) for about 18 month and found the sound to be amazing. I have purchased two dots since then and hooked up to Bluetooth speakers which makes them sound fine. I was so excited about the echo 2.0 with the \"improved sound\" when amazon announced it. I received it a few days ago and am totally disappointed in the audio quality. I cannot imagine who at amazon thinks this is \"improved sound\" over the original echo. Echo 2.0 looks good.....but the audio quality is awful....period! Amazon, for the first time ever you've let me down. I feel you mislead me and thousands of others with the marketing claim of \"improved audio\" in echo 2.0. Make it right, however you decide to do it, just make it right. Perhaps offer to refund half the cost to all purchasers since it sounds closer to the sound quality of dot rather than echo 1.0.",

I couldn\u2019t find anyone who thought the features offered justified the price and the HomePod didn\u2019t support my music provider of choice, Spotify. Joining the amazon universes has turned out better than I could have hoped for. Echo, seamlessly, supports Spotify (as well as most other music content providers from what I understand). Voice recognition is outstanding (dare I say it, much better than Siri). Sound quality is comparable with other Bluetooth speakers of this size (I\u2019ve owed several). The real surprise here was the content. Amazon refers to these as skills but what they amount to are lots and lots of tasks that the echo can perform, much like apps on a smartphone. Enabling individual skills allow you to access news, weatheer, sports, current events, and educational content in many different platforms and styles, as well as lots and lots of games. Echo links with your phone to enable phone calls, texts, reminders, and calendar events. Alexa will tell you joke, play your favorite radio station, give you a word of the day and tell you what to expect from the weather for today, or some day in the near future, just by asking. This would be a great deal for an alarm clock that functions as a radio as well. Considering the quality of the content provided, the features included, and the performance level achieved this is a steal at $100 ($69 on sale). Within a week I ordered 3 of the smaller (but with all the same features other than sound quality) echo dots. I still love my apple stuff but Have plenty of affection left over for Alexa.",

With that said, please keep in mind what your expectations are for this device. I currently use a Google operated Android phone and can say that Alexa is not all that interesting or comparative. If you like to say, \"Okay Google\" and immediately get where the nearest XYZ place is or if you want to know the name of that actor in that movie from that time, Alexa cant do that. I was excited to set up Alexa and was immediately disappointed. My expectations for Alexa were she will be here to answer all the weird things I ask Google throughout the day. Unfortunately, Alexa cant do that because well, Amazon doesn't have their own search engine to do those things. Alexa can be interesting if you download a \"skill\". Which is ridiculous. If you want movie trivia, you better hope someone developed a \"skill\" for that. The only 3 \"skills\" I'm impressed by is 1. their News skill for my \"morning briefing\" while I get dressed for work/school. You have to download each \"skill\" for each news source. 2. Is my weather ATIS/METAR \"skill\" as I am a pilot and often check the airport and local weather. 3. Is the thunderstorms \"skill\" to help me sleep. You have to customize Alexa to do the things you want her to do. She isn't tied to a search engine so asking her random questions is useless. She is fine as a home assistant. If you need her to set a timer, to remind you to do something, or if you need her to compile your grocery list, she can. Also, Im noticing that her vigilance has been hit, miss, and outright scary. When I first opened my Echo, Alexa was dying for my attention. Now, sometimes when I say her name, I get nothing. Other times she's decided to tell a joke or giggle unprompted which is weird.

Yes, Alexa was able to tell me the weather, order off Amazon, and play songs. And yes, it can even control smart devices. But after that the Amazon Echo is an absolute dud. And even the functions I just mentioned are extremely limited. When asking to play a song, if you don't designate a specific artist, Alexa simply picks one for you. And if you ask it to play a different version of that song, it always goes back to the one it originally picked. When looking for items on Amazon using the Echo, it typically locates the most expensive listing, and NEVER lists the least expensive offerings. There is only a handful of commands it is able to accomplish. As a bluetooth speaker it is okay. Poor volume maximum output, but still mostly acceptable. This is the only reason I chose to give it a two-star rating rather than a one-star. The absolute worst part is the utter failure of the AI interface. Rather it is a glaring example of AI failure. As long as you can stay within the boundaries of Echo's capabilities with the knowledge that the device is not capable of delivering outside of those binding limitations, then you might be able to enjoy it. But if your experience was like mine, you will find that within a week or two that it was a very poor investment.",

My kids love this device because they can play music and ask Alexa questions, so I decided to replace it. This version just suddenly stopped working a month ago. I have looked up online to find trouble shooting tips, but there aren't any tips for when it simply won't turn on. We kept this device on a shelf in one location in a safe place after what happened to the first one. I would give this a higher rating if I could get some customer service. On a side note, I am pleased that there is now a filter for explicit music. This was a BIG problem when we first got this device and it couldn't understand my 3 year old. Wow. I won't be replacing this one, because it didn't even last a year. *** UPDATE - finally figured out how to contact customer service for the warranty, and spoke to a very helpful person who is sending a new power cord. Hoping this fixes the problem! Added more stars for customer service.",

When it does play the sound quality is alright but if you go to max volume you can tell there is distortion. This is not what I expected for just under $100.00 Only reason I went with echo is because it supposedly had the most third party support so had a wider range of things it could do.

With this purchase, during Black Friday deals, I now have an Echo (2nd Generation) and an Echo Dot (2nd Generation). I purchased each one of these items so I can have music or talk radio playing through out the house. I really like the fabric choices of this 2nd Generation Echo. I also like that it is smaller than the 1st Generation Echo. I do not notice a sound difference in the speakers. I think both speakers are very good. A year ago I did not have Echo in the house and figured I did not need Alexa. Well, I am now a convert. I consider having Alexa here a real asset. I can find out what the temperature and weather is outside at my whim. She will set timers to help keep me on schedule. I can ask her to set an alarm for 6:20 am and she complies. I can tell her to play for an hour and a half and she turns off as directed. Because Alexa is constantly improving, I imagine there are things in the future she will assist me with that I have not even imagined today. If you are the type of person who just wants to take a product out of the box and with very little effort on your part have it do everything you have read about, you will be disappointed in Alexa. If however, you like searching for and trying new apps, then you are going to be extremely pleased with Alexa. My recommendation (born from experience) would be to purchase this 2nd Generation Echo.

            "review_text": "Amazon Echo is a great device (I was one of the first to have one and waiting for months for my first Echo to ship as Amazon vastly underestimated the demand for a device like this) and this Echo (2nd generation) is a good upgrade from the original. There is no volume ring on the 2nd gen Echo like there is on the original Echo and the 1st gen Echo Dot but it's no big deal as there are volume buttons now and the cost of the volume ring wasn't worth it if you ask me (it was nice, but for most people not worth the money). Most of the time you'll want to adjust the volume by voice anyway (like \"Alexa volume 5\"). I actually prefer the cheaper volume buttons on the Dot 2 to the volume ring now. The fact that you can just talk from across the room and it can hear you (most of the time) really sets this apart. If you think you already have an Echo because you have Siri, Cortana, or Google, then know that it's just not the same. Things I do: set timers, set alarms, get weather info, ask basic questions, listen to music (like Prime Music, Prime Stations, songs I bought, etc), listen to radio, ask for jokes, turn things on and off, and I'm sure I'm forgetting some things. The Echo really excels at playing music. I love it than I can ask for a song I want to hear and it will play it (most of the time anyway). At night I often listen to a local radio station and I just say \"Alexa stop\" without having to get out of bed when I want to stop listening. If you have multiple Echos then you can set up a music group and play the music through all of the Echos in the music group at the same time so you can play music throughout the entire house or just downstairs or wherever you want. UPDATE: I've ran into some bugs/issues with some Echos in a music group not playing music with the rest of the group so that's unfortunate. When I listen to Prime Station I can tell it \"thumbs up\" if I like the song or \"thumbs down\" if I don't... and when I listen to the station again it won't play the songs that I've thumbed down. Using the built-in speaker, the sound quality is quite good for the size and price. A big plus is the addition of an AUX output compared to the 1st gen Echo. I somewhat wish I could AirPlay to a device from the Echo when I'm playing music and want the best sound quality, however Bluetooth is pretty impressive when it uses the near-CD quality codecs. Positives: * I like the form factor better than the 1st gen - it's shorter and a little wider but feels quite substantial and has a great non-skid rubber or rubber-like base. * The somewhat feature that Amazon added (ESP - Echo Spatial Perception) so that the nearest Echo responds is fantastic. Unfortunately there does seem to be a minor downside: the Echo's response can sometimes be slightly delayed while multiple Echoes figure out which Echo is closest and should respond. * It seems to hear better when playing music than the first gen. It was annoying when you would try to talk to it while it was playing but it couldn't hear you. The new Echo hears better during music playback but it's still not \"Star Trek quality\" hearing; sometimes you may still need to raise your voice. * It's a good buy at the regular asking price and a better buy than the 1st gen Echo. * It has a 3.5mm stereo audio jack. Sound quality through this jack should be good enough for anyone except audiophiles. * Works great and stays connected to my Asus RT-AC68U router. * If you want to 'Wikipedia' something then you can say 'Alexa, Wikipedia <subject>'. She'll read a little from Wikipedia. If you want her to read more after she stops then just say 'Alexa, tell me more'. This can be useful sometimes. Negatives (mostly minor but take note): * While trying out Amazon Music Unlimited with the Echo I immediately ran into the issue of the Echo playing the explicit version of songs instead of the clean version. There should be an option to never play explicit songs and to play the clean version instead (some people have children). The workaround until Amazon addresses this problem is to add the clean song to your music library and then say \"Alexa play <song> from my library\". * The Android Amazon Alexa app can be slow and frustrating sometimes. There seems to be opportunity for speed improvement here. * The Android app has frustrating editing of text and does not allow you to tap the text in order to place the cursor for editing. I was trying to leave some feedback and needed to go back and edit but I cannot edit anything without deleting everything back to the point where I want to edit. Kind of ridiculous and very frustrating. The iOS app also suffers from this frustration (actually it seems you can get around it in iOS by holding your finger down but why are they making editing text so difficult?). * If you have lights in multiple rooms and Echos in multiple rooms then you might think that you could say \"turn on the lights\" and it would turn the lights on in that particular room based on which Echo heard the command... but alas, it does not seem possible to do this. You have to name the lights differently, like \"study light\" and say \"turn on the study light\". It's too bad you can't just say \"turn on the lights\" in the study and it will turn on the study lights because the Echo that is in the study heard the command. * Doesn't hear well in a noisy environment, or when other people (including on TV) are talking at the same time. Home Automation: * I use several Belkin WeMo switches to control some lights and fans. They work pretty well although not always perfectly. I also recently added a Philips Hue system as well. * I can control my Honeywell WiFi thermostats using the \"Honeywell Total Connect Comfort\" skill. I have two downstairs for 2 zones. I have one Honeywell RTH9580WF1005/W1 and one Honeywell RTH6580WF . * I recently set it up to turn on and off certain activities with a Logitech Smart Hub . For example, I can say \"Alexa, turn on TiVo\" and it will turn on the TV and my receiver and set the TV and receiver inputs correctly. I can then use the remote which is synced... and turn it all off with \"Alexa turn off TiVo\". There were some annoyances getting it all setup but I think it's pretty \"cool\" even though you can only start and stop activities with Alexa so you still need the remote to do other things (change channel, adjust volume, mute, pause, etc). * I think I've only really scratched the surface of what is possible with home automation. I have not tried IFTTT (\"if this then that\") recipes yet but I hear it is quite powerful and hope to try it out when I have more time to \"play\". Wishes: * High-quality digital audio output that is better than Bluetooth. If it had this then you could really get high quality audio output from it, but most people probably don't really care that much as analog out is \"good enough\". * Smarter. After 2 years I wish the Echo was smarter. Yes, it has definitely improved over time but Google can still answer more questions than Alexa. It's going to be hard to beat Google in answering general questions. * Severe weather alerts. I suggested these alerts a long time ago and they still haven't added it to my knowledge... perhaps due to legal reasons? If would be great if it would sound some sort of alarm or notification for severe weather. * Built-in support for notifying others that you might need help. This would be good for the elderly. There is a \"Ask My Buddy\" skill however, but the verbiage is a little awkward (\"Alexa, Ask My Buddy to Send Help\") and it's free so if the developer decides to stop support then that might leave a lot of people without service at an inopportune time. Compared to Google Home: * Setup on Google Home was super-simple, easier than Echo (the Android app worked really well and setup seemed streamlined) * Google Home is smarter for general questions... significantly smarter. I asked Google \"How long does it take to get to the Honda dealer in Lewisville\" and it told me about 26 minutes in current traffic conditions. Awesome. The Echo totally failed here. * No AUX audio output like on Echo Dot * I prefer saying \"Alexa\" to \"OK Google\" or \"Hey Google\" * I currently prefer Echo for music and smart home control but I consider Google Home a serious threat to Echo because it is more \"intelligent\" than Echo Other: * It doesn't come with a 3.5mm audio cable but I can understand why as many people would probably not use it and Amazon wants to get the cost as low as possible so this isn't a big deal. * About 10 or 15 minutes after setting it up, it said something like \"your Echo received an important update and must restart\". So if you are having issues with it then you may want to give it awhile so it can update if needed. * For better understanding of what you say, go to the Alexa app and Settings->Voice Training. While not perfect, I really like the Amazon Echo. I think the technology and potential is still in its infancy but the Echo is already really useful and excels at home automation, playing music, podcasts, and radio. I'm giving it 4 stars due to Google Home being much smarter at answering general questions and due to the negatives I've mentioned above. The Echo is a good device but I think you should also seriously consider Google Home, or maybe even both like I have.",

The sound difference between the echo and the dot is HUGE, and as a music lover I am really happy with this system. I've seen lots of people criticize the echo for \"not sounding good enough.\" I'm really curious what these people's definitiin of \"good enough\" is. I don't work in the music industry, audio is not my business, and I don't own any Bose products, but as an every day Spotify dwelling pesant, I'm really impressed with the echo. It sounds way better than my headphones and way better than the dot, and it gets LOUD. I'll say this though - I would like an interface to adjust bass/trebel. You can adjust it by telling Alexa to \"increase/decrease woofer\" and \"increase/decrease tweeter,\" but after issuing the command to decrease the bass several times, she continues to shake the floor of my second floor apartment at any volume higher than 2. I have the echo sitting on my computer desk. I'm sure my neighbors don't appreciate this :( Regarding Alexa herself - I love her, and she's really great with smart home stuff. I am an adult with ADHD and use her to set reminders and alarns. One time my husband locked himself out of the apartment and used Alexa's \"drop in\" feature to page the echo dot on my nightstand - he woke me right up and I let him in. I gotta say, we never anticipated Alexa would help us in a situation like that. Also Alexa's favorite game is Horizon Zero Dawn, which is one of my favorite games of all time. She's great.",

I was pleased to find that people are trying to improve it every day by creating new skills and analyzing voice bytes to make it more accurate. I have found that it can be extremely inconsistent though. In a quiet house without my family home, she can hear me from the bottom of my stairs 2 rooms away, but I can be standing 10 feet from the unit and speaking loudly and she has difficulty even picking up the Alexa wake word if she's playing music above volume 6. Also, another nit pick of mine is the limited ability to interpret speech. There are many times I'll try to say something and get the response, \"sorry, I don't know that,\" or be referred to the app on my phone. If you misunderstood me, that's one thing, but if I check the voice logs to find what I said verbatim then why doesn't my echo access the Internet to try and find at least a minimal answer? For instance, when a song is playing and I ask, \"Alexa, is this ACDC playing?\" I always get a confused response when I'm looking for a yes or no. But if I ask WHO is singing, she knows right away. I don't have a problem learning a list of command prompts if that's all the program is capable of, but I was hoping that we were moving away from that and into the future of limited AI.",

If you\u2019re thinking of purchasing for sound quality, go with the first generation or the Echo Plus. UPATE: A new software version was put out and the improved sound is great. Thank you.

I have no accent or speech problem, yet Alexa misunderstands me a lot. It is especially frustrating when playing a word game where you get more points for longer words and Alexa does not understand many big words. Sometimes have repeated a word 5 or 6 times and she doesn't get it. Also am a little disappointed with music feature. I like classical music, some of which is sacred and in latin. Alexa doesn't understand requests for music with Latin titles. Alexa is OK but not at all intuitive.",

It is a nice speaker, good looking too, so I have no gripes there, but I've found that for my uses, a portable WiFi speaker is more versatile. Alexa only has one speed for audiobooks and the voice command is not real responsive to my slow talking voice. It is much better for me to use a smart phone for controls rather than a voice-activated robot. Plus, my partner hates the dystopian voice that randomly talks into the air without voice activated commands.

If you want to make your home a smart home or just want to make life easy for certain tasks this is a great product to have. The commands on Alexa can be daunting from time to time, but you get used to using Alexa very quick. Also amazons AI is always learning and people usually are updating code all the time for Alexa so this can get better as time goes on. The speakers on this thing are very loud and I'm impressed with how clear they are. Its not Dobly atmos sound but you can notice the dobly sound power on Alexa at least on this Echo version. Alexa's integration with almost anything wifi is great, she even connects to my tile to help find my keys and phone when I miss place them. The amount of things Alexa can control is amazing. If your looking to jump in to a smart home or get a gift to a techie friend this is the one to give.",

So having a cell phone wasn't not mentioned in the advertizing to allow the calling and texting feature to work. My current cell phone only works with wifi which works great to download the amazon alexa app. I have onstar in my pick up so no need for a cell phone. So you need a working cell number with the right working system for the calling and texting features to work. I was offered small refund for my troubles but did return one of the 2nd generations because that person does not have a cell phone and will not buy one to have the calling and texting feature to work. You can use a friends cell phone and number example spouce, friend, family member, it will not take from their minutes or text I'm told by amazon. I also found out this week my parents echo the one where you have to push the button to make it wake up. Does not play the music my parents like from the 50's. Mine does. I would think amazon would want all the systems to work the same? My parents no longer use their push button amazon echo. I will get them a member ship so they can enjoy it more. I also saw a you tube video this week and the man stated how their are so many different amazon echos. I agree with him I think amazon needs to slow down on the number of echos they make and make them better with what they do!! Having to have a membership, certain echo, cell phone plans. Consumer Cellular has a phone plan for $10.00 a month since echo doesn't require a texting feature from your cell phone company. $15.00 plan for texting. But the phone that would have the android 5.0 is between $80.00 to 100.00 still. I phone may be different? I only asked about android phones. I'm happy with amazon service over all but I hope they keep the upgrades working to make echo smarter, and doing more.

The sound quality was always enough that I could hear the music but couldn't really pick up a while lot of detail and the low end frequency was really missing. Also, it didn't blend in with the living room decor, so it seemed to stick out a bit. The 2nd gen. has made big improvements to both. The Echo delivers cleaner, fuller sound while at the same time bringing enough low end to get really good all-around sound from a single speaker. The shorter wider profile along with the fabric cover make it fit in about anywhere in the living room. Microphone sensitivity and range is about the same as the original. The only negative thing I could say about it is I wish it still had the ring for volume adjustment. It made it easier to turn down after one of the kids had been listening to their music at near full volume or adjusting to just the right level for listening to music when company is over. Not that you can't do it by voice command, or the buttons on top of the new version, just a personal preference. Overall, I love it.

This product is great for listening to music/audiobooks, making lists, setting alarms, and providing news and weather updates. The Amazon Echo is simple to set up and compatible with a variety of apps on your smartphone. Amazon music, Pandora, Spotify, allrecipies, and ecobee are just some of the skills the echo is able to utilize. This review will evaluate the following three criteria to help you make an informed decision if this product is capable of enhancing your life. Features The Amazon Echo comes with a variety of features that will help anyone stay organized, informed, and entertained. The Alexa app allows users to conveniently link their apps to the speaker with ease. The manufacturer recommends buying amazon music for a low monthly price which gives you access to unlimited music. If you are looking for free music Pandora is an excellent option. The echo allows you to stay connected by syncing your contacts, so you can use it as a device for calling. With Bluetooth connection any device can use the speaker to amplify their music or videos. The Echo is great for checking the weather, setting alarms, and comes with a built in Jeopardy game. With home adapters the echo also is able to control your thermostat, lights, and television. Usability The Echo is extremely user friendly. For set up, the device comes with step by step instructions. Once you have the Echo set up the possibilities are endless. For best use make sure the Echo is in the center of room and away from any televisions or radios. This allows for the device to clearly and effectively communicate with you. In order to receive the most out of your product internet access is vital. It is also recommended that users have smartphones as this allows for the most effective management and usability. As stated earlier, the Amazon Echo can help you with all your entertainment, communication, and organizational needs. Design The second-generation Echo is designed to look great in any home. The variety of colors give the owner the ability to match it to their surroundings. The speaker has been upgraded in this version for a clear and crisp sound. The Echo is fit with a ring of lights that make communication clear and effective for all users. There are buttons on the top that make it clear to the user how to change the volume, mute the speaker, and initiate communication. I hope this review has been helpful in your purchasing decision.",

Advertising of the product is excellent; however, actual performance leaves much to be desired. A nice toy if you need to know what time it is and are too lazy to look at your wrist watch, or to use it as a timer, but if you want a recipe or music you better b prepared to subscribe to some PAY site(s) in order to get information/music in return..

There are many different actions that the Echo can perform that make life easier. The criteria I used in my evaluation of the Amazon Echo include: sound quality, assistant quality, and overall appearance. You can use the Echo, not only as a virtual assistant, but as a high quality Bluetooth speaker. The sound quality is good, and includes a great downward facing sub that produces a rich sound profile. The speaker sounds great for any genre of music, and is loud enough to fill an entire room. Though, the speaker is only part of what makes the Echo great. The Amazon Echo has the best virtual assistant, Alexa. Alexa is by far better than any other virtual assistant on the market. It is a very accurate and easy to understand. It has a wide array of accepted commands, and is very helpful in making your day easier. My favorite feature would have to be the ability to set alarms for the following day, entirely with your voice. On top of that, it works with a large amount of third-party devices and applications. This network of third-party devices far exceeds that of any other voice assistant. The design of the 2nd Generation Echo is very aesthetically pleasing. Compared to the 1st generation, the 2nd generation echo had a much stronger focus on design. I personally ordered the Charcoal Fabric Echo; however, there is a design that would fit almost anyone\u2019s taste. The fabric does a great job covering the, in my opinion, obnoxious speaker holes on the side of the device. I also appreciate the overall size reduction of the 2nd Generation Echo. Overall, I would highly recommend the 2nd Generation Amazon Echo. For the price, you can\u2019t get any other virtual assistant that comes close to this quality.",

Because of this lack of ability to hardwire you can expect some latency from most bluetooth devices making watching movies from your computer, using Alexa as a speaker terrible. The picture and sound will be out of sync. 3. Have multiple devices connecting to Alexa? Forget about choosing the one you want to be connected in that moment. It seems to always only want to connect to the device that you DONT want it to connect to in that moment. Therefor you have to unpair it and repair it to devices consistently if you have multiple phones and computers in your household.

Most reviews complain about the sound quality but I didn't notice that so much. - Lack of response What bothered me the most was the unresponsiveness. The wake word works great, even at a whisper it will start listening, but it very frequently doesn't hear the command and just keeps listening and listening... and listening. My 1st gen would stop listening pretty quick if it doesn't hear anything or respond with \"I don't understand\" or something, the 2nd gen seems to listen forever and doesn't respond to even yelling at it. The times that it does respond, answers are often cut off: \"Alexa, what's the speed of light?\" - \"Light's top speed is 299 mil\" with a little static noise as it cuts out. - Lowest spoken volume is too loud The second annoyance is that the \"level 1\" volume is much louder than the 1st gen \"level 1\". With the 1st gen I usually kept it around 3 or 4 when listening to music and 2 when I'm working and want some background music, but with the 2nd gen, I usually have it on 1 or 2 and have to get up and press the volume down button to get a quieter volume. Also, when I have it on 1 and my sister \"drops in\" on me, the music resumes at level 3 afterward instead of going back to 1. - Glitchy There are also other occasional glitches, like one time my sister dropped in and the volume did \"not\" go up for the conversation, also sometimes the music volume doesn't go down when the Echo is listening. - Alarm doesn't work I set two daily morning alarms and they both have failed to ring! I checked the settings multiple times. I'm very happy with the 1st gen, it misunderstands me less than 10% of the time but it does or says something. Not being heard over 50% of the time with the 2nd gen is too much to take. I tested all three and reset one of them twice with no change.",

Repeated instructions to 'shut off' 'stop playing' 'off' go ignored and instructions to change volume to specific levels also go ignored. The units appear to hear the instructions (the blue light ring), but then after a second or two go back to doing whatever they were doing. Sometimes lowering the volume for a second or two then raising it again. And if a specific volume number is given it will be ignored as verified by the Alexa app. It seems that the only way to control these units in a group is to use the Alexa app as voice commands seem to be ignored half of the time I personally don't want to send the units back as they (as hardware) are okay but the software is substandard especially for Amazon.

The new unit has a very substantial heft. It sounds amazing on voice and music. The sound is truly room filling. It has worked flawlessly since purchase in December. WiFi set up up is super easy. Love the corny jokes and puns from Alexa. We are into trivia programs. Thank you for making a quality product that is fun to use, and actually works as advertised, out of the box.",

The strange thing is that the Alexa app shows that its still playing even though nothing is coming out of echo.What upsets me more is I've emailed numerous times and haven't received any response (its been over a week) and I called customer service tech support and instead of letting me talk to tech rep I had to talk to a operator that had to relay back in forth between me and the tech????? after going back and forth for an hour I just hung up because I was getting nowhere. I absolutely love Amazon and have been a prime member for years, but I honestly don't know why this issue cannot be fixed, or at least put the effort into fixing the problem. I purchased 3 of these one for each kid's room. If they do not resolve this issue whether by updating echo, or the alexa app or whatever is causing this problem, I will be returning them before 30 days is up! Please fix!!!! I still believe in you! UPDATE! November 6, 2017 I was conacted by an Amazon rep which inquired abour the problem I\u2019m having with echo not looping throughout the night! She stated that one of the technicians could not get an echo to replicate the problem. She said she will forward all my details to him and see if they can figure out what\u2019s going on, and get back to me if they figure it out. Very nice representative that I\u2019m happy got in touch with me, BUT I still don\u2019t understand why I couldn\u2019t speak directly with an actual Technician \ud83e\udd14which in my opinion would increase the speed in resolving this issue. Maybe I\u2019m just old school and this is the way matters get resolved nowadays. When I got off the phone I deleted the alexa app and reinstalled to see if that might clear up the problem, but my echos still couldn\u2019t keep my rain sounds playing throughout the night! I personally think the problem is with the alexa app, it\u2019s been pretty glitchy and if you read the reviews about the alexa app there are many negative reviews.

I have been testing both Alexa voice and music, and while the software update does slightly improve the audio quality for music, it still sounds very constrained and about as good as a small low end Bluetooth speaker. Audio quality for the Alexa voice is still pretty muddy compared to the Echo Gen 1. I am returning the six Echo Gen 2 devices that I bought and replacing them with Echo Gen 1 devices. I notice that Amazon limits the quality of Echo Gen 1 devices they allow you to buy, so if you are thinking of swapping out Gen 1 for Gen 2, you probably want to buy the Gen 1 devices soon. I feel I gave the Gen 2 device a fair shake, but the hardware and the software are just not of high enough quality compared to the Gen 1 device. It's too bad because I really like the form factor and the fact that you can get different skins for the device. But, my primary use of the Echo devices is for Alexa voice control and response, and I need the voice to be clear, and the Echo Gen 1 (and the Echo Dot Gen 2) provide a crisp, clear Alexa voice. I listen to music on Sonos so the music playback quality of an Echo device is of secondary importance for me. I bought six of these to replace some Echo Dots and one Echo Gen 1. I am planning on returning all six, after having configured and used three of them for a few days. The sound quality of this device is horrible. I use my Echo for home control, flash briefings, dad jokes, etc... and not much for music (I control Sonos with Alexa for music). The Echo Gen 2 has a very muddy sounding Alexa voice, and the music sounds very constrained. I have read that Amazon pushed a software update to select customers to \"fix\" the audio issues but I'm not sure that I'm willing to gamble that this will actually work to improve the sound. Let's see if Amazon reaches out to me and offers me the update in the next few days before I return these. I also don't understand what benefits the Dolby technology gives to the Echo Gen 2, I was expecting tremendously great sound with the Dolby technology but was sorely dissapointed. The package also claims that the microphone array is much improved but in my experience, the Echo Gen 1 units do just fine in all the rooms of my house where I have them.

Having said that, the functionality I do have works seamlessly, and it sounds quite ok once you recognize it for what it is. I have it hooked up via a logiteck blue tooth device to my 30 year old traditional stereo, this feature alone made it well worth the purchase.

            "review_text": "In July, we purchased an Amazon Echo for our home. Within a few days of using it we upgraded to Amazon Music Unlimited for the Echo. We loved the product and it worked great! In August, I read an article online that stated you could use Amazon Music Unlimited for the Echo on multiple Echoes at the same time, and this was a new change. I felt that the article must be mistaken because it sounded \u201cto good to be true\u201d. I did some research online at Amazon, and this didn\u2019t appear to be true. At this point I decided to contact Amazon\u2019s Customer Service via chat. The person I spoke to was very nice and helpful. I asked if you could use one Amazon Music Unlimited for the Echo account on to listen to different music on multiple echoes at the same time. The representative informed me that you could. I asked again to clarify and received the same response. Needless to say, I was excited. At this point, my wife and I decided that we could use 2 additional echoes to play music at different locations. Researching that the new echo would be coming out in Nov. We placed an order for two additional devices. Inspired by pleasure for the single echo, we decided to take the next step and planned on creating a smart home. We purchased several hundred if not a thousand dollars of equipment with the plan of using the 3 echoes. We would not have done this if the Amazon Music Unlimited for the Echo didn\u2019t work like the Customer Service Represent stated. Our shipment of echoes arrived Oct 30. After setting the devices up, I tried to play a song and was informed that it required Amazon Music Unlimited. I looked at the Alexa app and didn\u2019t see a place to set it up. At this point, I decided to contact Amazon\u2019s customer support. I chatted with Melwin and described my issue. At this point, I was informed that I would have to upgrade to Amazon Music Unlimited for $7.99 a month for it to work as I wanted. I asked to be able to play different music on all three devices at the same time (Not multi-room). The customer service representative informed me that with Amazon Music Unlimited that I could play music on up to 6 devices at the same time and that would solve my problem. I was not happy with this information. I would not have purchased the additional echoes nor the smart home devices. Now, I was being told that I would need to spend an additional $48 a year. The representative offered me a $10 coupon for my trouble and incorrect information given. After a few days of thinking and cooling down, I thought of many different scenarios from returning all the devices that I could to just paying the extra $48 a year. We have been loyal customers since the 1990s and love Amazon. You have never disappointed us in the past and went to great lengths to make us happy. So we decided not to let one bad experience change our attitudes of almost 25 years of great service. Today, we were playing music on the device with Amazon Music Unlimited for the Echo account. I went downstairs and wanted to listen to music on one of the other devices. I thought that I could at least listen to Amazon Music on the device. Within a minute of starting the music the other device\u2019s music stopped playing. After doing a little research I found that we could only have one music stream going at a time period. At this point, I figured that I would have to upgrade to Amazon Music Unlimited for $7.99 to solve this issue. While not happy, I was resigned to this solution. Before I signed up for the additional expense of Amazon Music Unlimited, I thought I would look closer at the issue. I had been given incorrect information once before. Upon reading about the different plans of music at Amazon and different websites sites, I believe that Amazon Music Unlimited would not solve my problem either. I would need Amazon Music family plan $14.99 to solve my issues! At this point, I am speechless and greatly disappointed. I can understand the mistake of the first customer service representative, but the second one is dumbfounding me. After knowing that a customer was given incorrect information that cost him over a thousand dollars, the representative should give a 100% correct answer the second time. Including stating \u201clet me research this and get back to you.\u201d Maybe I am misreading the plans and the Amazon Music Unlimited will solve my issue. Finally, I am told that you can stream different music only to one device at a time regardless of the plan. Needless to say, but we are very disappointed with the incorrect information that setup back at least a thousand dollars.",

However, the new device is connected to a CyberPower 3-outlet surge unit to be on the safe side. Anyway, Amazon was gracious enough to provide a modest credit ($30) for the purchase of a new 2nd generation Echo. We obtained the charcoal fabric and so far like the smaller size and enjoy hearing Alexa's voice again. It was easy to set-up and pair up with our network. I read many reviews of the sound quality differences and this one (2nd Gen) sounds more or less the same, maybe less bass that I can recall. Also, I was able to easily pair my remote from the 1st gen Echo to the 2nd gen as the current model doesn't come with a remote. Just go into settings on the Amazon Alexa app and click on the Echo your using and look for Connected Devices and click on pair remote. This is the app from the Play Store for Android. Looking at the Alexa app, I see the latest software update was pushed to the new Echo device (Latest Software Version: 595530420). Overall, we just use it for playing music from the Amazon library and really don't use many features its capable of but will probably do some research of the other functions.

Music: If you do not want to pay for music you are pretty much stuck with Pandora. You can still use your phone as a Bluetooth device you can't play directly from the device. You also cannot upload your own music to Amazon Music without a subscription. Knowledge: This is not a Google device and the questions that you ask cannot always be answered correctly. This device is great for weather and random notifications but not great for asking questions.

Alexa sounded pretty drunk when it responds to whatever I asked it to do, which was actually more comical than irritating. I guess after a night or two (and several one star reviews later), there was an update to the Echo firmware and it somehow improved the audio quality making music sound halfway decent, and Alexa sounds like she is sober enough to recite my reminders for the day (as if I was that important). Honestly, the speaker sounds decent, it's neither the bottom of the barrel nor the top of the crop. (Ugh, corny, I know.) Alexa works as expected. That's pretty much it.

Echo II looks to be a fine addition to our household. We have prime, so tons of music available- so far have asked Alexa to play: soft jazz; Rhapsody in Blue (she brought up the Leonard Bernstein/New York Philharmonic version); Cake; ZZ Top; Vince Guaraldi.

They came on transferring me to a fire tv tech. I new it was not my fire tv because I also have an echo dot. So I connected my echo dot with the same fire tv unlinked my echo and linked my echo dot. Everything worked perfectly. So it has to be my new echo with issues. They had me try everything but nothing worked. Even one tech said I just need to use the remote control. Reall??!!!

I can\u2019t hear my 1st generation dot play music while I\u2019m in the shower or having other stuff on well bec it\u2019s so underpowered (not so stylish either) so I pulled the trigger and got a second gen echo and I am very impressed. The sound bugs everyone is complaining about are not there once it updates and reboots itself upon set up. The sound quality is MUCH better than the 1st gen dot however a little less than the echo. I own 1 first gen dot and two echos and this has 50% increased in volume from the original little echo and is a legitimate music player. It is a little less basey and clear than the 1st gen original echo in side by side comparison but not too noticeable where it\u2019d really matter because it\u2019s still half the price and looks waaaay better. That\u2019s the second best thing is the style really is something that looks premium and high quality and blends into any space. With the selection of colors it\u2019s a great option for any room or environment and fits better than the 1st gen dot or echo and isn\u2019t an eye sore. I\u2019m definitely buying another soon for $79 that\u2019s a great deal and the performance it gives in comparison to the echo is worth the price especially with how much more eye friendly and stylish it is. Pros: 1) Price, 2) Far louder and better sound than 1st gen dot 3) Sound quality is great, bugs are fixed 4) very stylish and looks great Cons: 1) little less crisp, clear and basey than the original echo Opinion: this is a great investment. It\u2019s waaay better than the original dot. It\u2019s a legitimate speaker and great for bedroom or living room, especially in an apartment or smaller room it will fill it up. However, I\u2019d invest in an echo or even better, a designated speaker designed for music if your looking something exclusively for music for a larger space or for those who want a premium quality for listening as bose/other brands have better sound playing devices for $100 price range and then just use the dot/echo for your lights, information and commands.",

            "review_text": "2018-MAR-29 Revision Revision - lost my internet before finished. YOU CAN, on the ALEXA APP, delete history, but; you must enter each device, and then each recording, and delete them ONE BY ONE. This is SLOW and very CUMBERSOME. At the least, I should be able, to select a SINGLE DEVICE and SELECT DELETE ALL. This is NOT an option on the ALEXA APP. I have 5-devices that RECORD. So consider if I have 5-devices, and each device has 10-to-15-different recordings, that means I have to hit \"DELETE\" 50-to-75-times before I have DELETED all of my so-called HISTORY! If I could do it at the DEVICE level, I would only have to do it 5-times. Seriously, deleting recordings is a very difficult thing. And, I am very annoyed at the BIG GLARING RED CIRCLE on top of each ECHO, when I MUTE the microphones! It really should GLOW RED for perhaps 1-minute, then; VERY SLOWLY, BLINK RED - where by - it is OFF for 5-seconds, then slow FLASH red for 2-seconds, then 5-seconds off, then 2-seconds on. Or something like that. NOT that UGLY --CONSTANT-- RED RING on top when ever the microphones are OFF. Seriously. guys? 2018-MAR-29 Follow on - REVISED. I still have an ISSUE - but - I MUST revise my statement. According to AMAZON, it does not record unless Alexa hears her wake word, and; then you are only going to be recorded for what \"she\" must hear, in order to respond properly to your request. THAT is what Amazon says will happen. BUT, It also says you can DELETE the recordings via the ALEXA APP. That is NOT TRUE. I have the ALEXA APP on my SAMSUNG phone, and; there is absolutely NO WAY TO DELETE RECORDINGs from that device. It is NOT supported there. Moreover, as it appears that I can only delete recordings from my laptop, there is still NO FEEDBACK that when I ask for my recordings to be deleted, that they are actually DELETED. As I stated before, it says a \"request is acknowledged\" but not actually \"done\". And it SAYS that if you push the microphone button, that it shuts off the microphones on the device. I am dubious if this is true, and; it is really ANNOYING that it shines RED when you do this. Why not shine RED for a Moment, then BLINK VERY SLOW RED, until you turn it on again? If I want to leave it OFF, for hours, or even DAYS - I don't want to therefore WASTE the light - or over time burn the LED out. Still, when I first reviewed my recordings here, there were several instances where stuff I did NOT want RECORDED was actually recorded. And a LOT of crap from my TV, where Alexa responded to the TV that was playing, and recorded useless stuff from there. So, I apologize to AMAZON for my outburst saying they are recording us, they are, but \"NOT SO MUCH\" as I believed. I am still in doubt, and dubious about DELETE. Why can I NOT simply say, \"Alexa - delete my recordings.\"??? ******** Okay, I have a serious ISSUE with the ALEXA interface. I just learned, that ALEXA and my ECHO devices, are, according to AMAZON, \"Constantly Listening\". Okay, I get it. It has to \"Listen\" to know when you are ASKING it to do things for you. Fine. BUT, did you also know it is CONSTANTLY RECORDING? That's right. It is not MERELY LISTENING. It is also CONSTANTLY RECORDING EVERYTHING that is making SOUND in your HOME! AND, the ONLY WAY TO DELETE THOSE RECORDINGS, is to LOGIN TO AMAZON, via a LAPTOP, and MANAGE those recordings. WORSE, even when you order them to DELETE MY RECORDINGS, it does not do that! It says, \"Your Request has been SENT\" You never EVER get an actual acknowledgement that the RECORDINGS are BEING DELETED! There are those who try to draw attention to \"This could be used against you in Law Enforcement\". I am doing NOTHING that matters in that regard. THAT is not why I CARE about being RECORDED ALL THE FRAKKING TIME! Consider the more OBVIOUS PRIVACY ISSUES - that have absolutely NOTHING to do with being ILLEGAL or such like: Do YOU WANT AMAZON RECORDING YOU .... * You reminding the kid(s) of the FRONT DOOR LOCK code? * You discussing your private FINANCIAL facts with your spouse? * You lecturing your kid about DRUGS? * How about you and your mate making LOVE at night? * THAT - is why AMAZON ECHO RECORDing is BAD. Listening? Sure, I get that. But RECORDING? And NOT DELETING THEM EASILY by saying: ALEXA - DELETE ALL OF MY RECORDINGS RIGHT NOW! You CAN'T. And I, personally, have a SERIOUS ISSUE WITH THAT. RECORDING? That I cannot merely say, \"ALEXA DELETE MY RECORDINGS\"? WHY NOT???!!! 2017-DEC-07 Follow on All in all, I like this device. It plays my Amazon music very well, and; the \"daily briefings\" and \"Reuters News\" are nice to have. I hope that as time passes, I will find more things to do. It is fun to ask Alexa things just to see what she \"knows\". I think Amazon should make it more clear where to go to learn more. Perhaps a devoted web page or three. The ONLY thing that is \"funny\" and \"off\", is that I have mine seated near one of my TVs. And, Randomly, when I am watching shows, the sound from the TV activates Alexa, and; it is funny to hear her respond to the TV rather than to me. No complaint about that. It is impossible for it to not happen. Though it is really funny when it does! The sound quality is outstanding. And, NOW I have two of them paired. They play music very well in sync. I'm a TECH, so; it makes me wonder what kind of firmware algorithm is used to make it so perfectly synced. Cudoz to the men and women who made that possible. I know that it had to be a serious challenge to make it so! If you want a laugh or three, ask Alexa to sing and also to tell you stories. ;O) 2017-NOV-22 Follow on Okay, really, it is a nice device. It needs MORE functionality, but; it is overall, a good buy, if you want help with your memory and lists and reminders and such like. I found that the recurring reminder is there, just not obvious - though - it should be. Search on Amazon. I'm working on it now. As for Alexa, for some of us, nice is important. One GLARING oversight... She does not respond to courtesy. You folks need to get her to RESPOND to \"Thank You Alexa\" with \"You are welcome.\" or better, \"You're Welcome Roger.\" or \"You are very welcome!\" AND best, a combination of either response - or even all three of them, randomly, whenever the user says, \"Thanks Alexa\" or \"Thank you Alexa\". or even just \"Thank you\" and \"Thanks\". It should be no issue for it to recognize at nice THANK YOU and reply. The ability to do so would add to the illusion that Alexa is your \"friendly helper\". Food for thought. --------------------------------------------------- (original posting) This is my initial thoughts ONLY. I am still getting to know this device. So far, the PRO(s) are, it is smaller than I thought it would be, which is nice. and, the sound quality is fabulous! It plays my Amazon Prime music very nicely. Alexa responds very well to my voice without any special \"training\", from 10-feet away across the room. I don't have to \"yell at it\" or anything. Just speak to her normally. That's really nice. And, the Alexa voice is easy to understand, and; well programmed to reply. CON(s), though only MINOR: I had to EJECT then, REMOVE the SD-CARD, and also REBOOT my phone, to get the ALEXA APP to install on my NOTE 4 running Droid 4.4.4. Before doing that, I wasted nearly an hour trying over, and over, to download and install the app. It downloaded fine, but; REFUSED to install. And on every failed install, it would \"claim\" it could not download. My download manager showed clearly that it was downloading fine. Frankly, I do NOT like that I must use my PHONE to \"configure\" and \"modify\" the settings for this device. THAT was not clear online. I would think AMAZON would ALSO supply me with a WINDOWS application for this. But, so far, I cannot find one. Seriously, it would be nice to NOT have to use ONLY my phone for the setup and reconfiguration activities. Yes, I know the CHILDREN do EVERYTHING on their phones. BUT, I am a DINOSAUR, and I use my LAPTOP far more than my phone for \"things\". Just a thought. The built in activities are rather LIMITED. It does NEWS only from Reuters, and; will NOT allow me to RE-DO the news for \"today\". That is annoying. I don't always get to catch all of the information on the first pass. So, it seems that I should be able to RE-LISTEN to the same news cast - on DEMAND - All the time. But, once you have done the news \"today\", Alexa says, \"You've already listened to your news\" and refuses to do it again for \"today\". I have not YET done it, but; I like that I can set up the device to REMIND ME of things, \"to-do\", and; also - to put things in my Amazon cart, and; also to BUY THINGs without being on the laptop, and; to give me order status alerts for Amazon purchases. I look forward to trying these features. BAD BAD BAD is... She does a terrible job of reading my KINDLE BOOKS. So bad in fact, that; it is not really worth doing. You cannot tell Alexa to SKIP over the Table of contents, or GOTO PAGE 1 or GOTO CHAPTER 3. Nothing like that. You cannot tell her to SKIP a page, or RE-READ anything. AND the biggest problem, she reads FAR TOO FAST. And telling her to \"READ SLOWER\" appears to do something, but; really - she reads at a breakneck pace, and; there is not way to make her read slower. I will report again when I have had time to try the other things it clams to do. But so far, I LIKE the ECHO, and; the Alexa app is seamless with it. If Amazon can make it READ MY KINDLE BOOKS - and not keep telling me to get an AUDIBLE ACCOUNT, that would be a greatly appreciated thing to improve! 2017-NOV-19 - additional follow-up: Okay, in general, this device works well. Some thoughts about how it can be IMPROVED. When talking to the device, it would be good if Alexa responded to polite interactions. If I say, \"Alexa, Thank You\", she should reply with \"You're Welcome!\" or even \"You're Welcome Roger.\" Another Improvement, would be, to allow VOLUME to be SOFTWARE DRIVEN. Today, I MUST walk across the room to make it LOUDER or SOFTER. By pushing the VOLUME buttons. BUT, that is rather counter-intuitive. Since it does \"everything else\" by voice.... It makes sense that it would ALSO allow me to say, \"Alexa, Volume Up please.\" \"Alexa. Volume Down please\". And, \"Alexa, MUTE please\" \"Alexa, UN-MUTE please\". With positive reply from Alexa, like: \"Your Device will be muted until you UN-MUTE or restart it\". And, \"Your device is now UN_MUTED Roger.\" It could, and perhaps should, also have a few more APPs available. I cannot say, for sure, what they might be. But, interaction between Alexa and the USER is the key. For instance, since it has TIMER(s) and REMINDER(s), it would be good to be able to have it, perform actions every day at given times--Recurring Reminders. The obvious reminders like: \"Roger, It's NOON - time for lunch.\" or \"Roger, it's 7pm, time to call your Mother.\" Stuff like that - that repeat - DAILY. I still think Alexa should be able to READ my KINDLE books, with a SLOWER PACE. And, be told to SKIP pages, or even chapters.\" Right now, it annoyingly reads every single thing, including table of contents, etc. And, it does NOT remember where it left off. This would be useful. To have Alexa READ a kindle, and; like me, place a bookmark, and resume reading by saying, \"Roger, we last left off in Chapter ###, page ###.\" Being even smarter, would be to BACKUP a paragraph, or so, when resuming. BUT, that would be far beyond what I am sure these young developers are capable of doing. In summary: The ECHO is a solid device. It's sound quality is outstanding! And, it does a very nice job of playing my AMAZON music. It should have some improvements like: (A) Allow (also) LAPTOP - not merely PHONE - to interface with the device; (B) Allow (also) for SOFTWARE volume UP/DOWN/MUTE/UN_MUTE; (C) Have REPEATED REMINDERS; (D) Have PACE variable speed READING of KINDLE BOOKS; (E) Have MORE built-in applications - and perhaps more NEW(s) source options. I hope to see some of these improvements in 2018. ;O)",

I have gone through all the steps both have suggested and still not working. I am so tired of this!!! Alexa talks too fast and just mumbles when you ask her things. You ask her to repeat and you have to go through the whole initial asking of the questions, again. She is not conversant like Google devices. Alexa is wordy when you ask her to set a timer and wordy when you ask her to play music even telling you she doesn\u2019t see any speakers. Alexa has difficulty responding to wake command must be repeated several times. If she is learning, she is very, very slow. I hear of people setting these devices up easily but if there are glitches, there is little help and it is incredibly time consuming (2 months so far). I\u2019m thinking in another day or two, I\u2019ll just pack up the three devices and send back to try Google Home. Costs the same and they are supported with better phone support via Costco. Sonos speakers still work via my smart devices, just not via voice commands on Alexa. Converting to a smart home is expensive and time consuming.

            "review_text": "I\u2019ve had my Echo 2 for about a week now and pretty much concluded that I\u2019m going to return it, it\u2019s minor advantage of better sound isn\u2019t enough for me to recommend it. There are several reasons for this. First, I already own an Echo Dot and I find it better serves me than the Echo 2. The Echo 2 does have better sound but for me this is unemportant since I mostly use the Dot for podcasts and news where sound quality isn\u2019t a factor, if I am going to listen to music I just turn on a spare sound bar in my living room and the Dot connects and I have better sound quality than the Echo 2, the two devices otherwise share exactly the same functionally. In the final score, all things considered, the Echo Dot is the superior device, at half the price. Here\u2019s why: 1. The Dot is half the price 2. About 1/4 the size 3. Performs exactly the same as the Echo 2 4. Uses Micro USB cable & extensions for power 5. Can use any USB charger => 500 MA output 6. Can run off any USB 2000 mh+ battery that charges phones and tablets ($15 - $25.00) 7. Plugged into a battery it can run all day on battery alone, no hunting for a socket 8. The Dot is portable, the Echo 2 -> slaved to its proprietary power supply, is not. Let me be honest. From the second I saw that ugly wall wart and proprietary cable connector I hated the Echo 2, I knew immediately, before turning it on that I was going to hate it because wall sockets are at a premium in my house. Worse, the sockets are almost always fully occupied, buried behind furniture and such. Early this year I changed most of the outlets in my house to ones that have USB sockets as well so I didn\u2019t need to have extensions, socket adapters and so on, a ten foot after market USB extension cable can be had here for $5.00 at the local \u201cFive Below\u201d Store. None of this works for the Echo 2. With its clunky wall wart and a proprietary connector it is slaved to only the included power cord. Can\u2019t use it outside, can\u2019t use it anywhere without an outlet. Had I been aware of this failing of the Echo 2 I would not have ordered it, the far smaller, cheaper and much more flexible Echo Dot is simply a better choice. If I want to use it somewhere that has no wall socket I just plug it into one of my 8000 mh batteries, works for hours.",

            "review_text": "Overall, the Echo is an excellent product to add to your home. When I heard about the Echo back in 2014, I was very skeptical someone could come up with something useful for it to do unless you were entrenched in the Smart Home world. Fast forward three years, and I currently own two Echo Dots and a regular Echo. As long as you like music and even occasionally search the internet or set a timer, you will enjoy the Echo. Things I like: First off, when I was reading reviews trying to decide if I was going to purchase an Echo or get a Dot and a speaker, I read a lot of reviews that slammed the new Echo for poor sound quality. I personally have not noticed any issues. It has a good amount of bass, and music sounds good at almost any volume level. Is it a $500 home stereo system? No, but it's more than competent. for most music listeners. While you can buy a Dot and a speaker, I wouldn't recommend it simply because the Echo is a much more streamlined and attractive way to listen to music. I own an iPhone, and as pretty much everyone knows, Siri isn't exactly the smartest assistant out there. I can't compare it to the Google Assistant, but I can say that Alexa is more than competent. There are only a couple of times where she hasn't had an answer for what I'm looking for, but overall, she pretty much has a good answer. It's kind of silly, but one of my favorite things are her jokes. They're always a punny kind of funny, and it's one of those ways that Amazon made sure Alexa seems like a natural part of your home. The only thing Amazon should add to the Echo is the ability to search using Bing. I say Bing because Google uses its own search engine for its Home speakers, so Amazon will have to turn somewhere else for searches. Right now, the functionality is missing (as far as I know,) so adding at least some ability to search would put the Echo that much further ahead of the Google Home. If you get an Echo, you will more than likely get some form of smart home device. When I bought my 3rd Echo, I got an offer to buy a TP-Link mini plug for $10. I took the plunge and now use it to control the lamp next to my bed. Overall, Echo integration works well and makes lighting even more convenient. My favorite thing is the routines, where you can tell Alexa a catchphrase and she will do several things at once. For example, I have it set so that when I wake up, I say \"Alexa, good morning,\" and she will turn on the lights and begin my flash briefing. It's really a slick process that you don't realize how much you'll use it until you have it in your home. Things that need work: BY FAR, the biggest con for Echo users is the Alexa app, at least on iOS. Setting up my Echo, it couldn't connect to my home Wifi network and failed three times. I had to use my phone as a hotspot and then come back in about an hour to connect it to my Wifi network. When I'm trying to pause music on the Alexa app, it usually won't actually pause the music. It's not necessarily huge things that ruin the Alexa app, but it's the sum of the little glitches that make it frustrating at least. The multi-room music works most of the time, but if one of the Echos gets turned off, it messes the entire thing up. The way Amazon has set up the households is annoying as well, mainly with relation to smart home. If you add a smart home device to one account, it won't automatically sync with the other accounts attached to your Echo, meaning you have to manually add each skill, smart device, and routine to each account. I get why skills and music doesn't transfer between the two, but really Amazon? If we're in the same house, we are going to use the same smart home devices. Please fix! The smart home section of the app could use some beefing up. Mainly, I want the ability to tell a group of lights to turn off at sunrise, on at sunset through the Alexa app. Can I do it through the individual apps of each device? Yes, but it would be a lot more convenient to be able to take care of it all through the Alexa app. Overall, I really do enjoy my Echo. The positives more than outweigh the negatives. If you've been wondering whether or not you are going to buy one for a while, take the plunge, especially with the $20 off deal going on right now. You won't regret it.",

Sadly, Amazon is needing to rely on heavy EQing to attempt to make a speaker artificially sound good when they should have relied more on acoustic design. ***Update*** Amazon contacted me and they are currently working on improving the audio experience through a firmware update that alters the EQ. The EQ edit essentially drops the mid frequencies and possibly some of the high-end frequencies too. Still, without a bass reflux system we saw in the 1st gen, I don\u2019t know how much better the bass response can get. I really wish Amazon would have invested more into the audio quality.

The new Echo sounds like the 40-year old plastic piece of junk you find in back room kitchens, covered in duct tape, with a broken cassette deck. Tinny mid-range, lack of bass. Polka & Mariachi music never sounded so good, I suppose, but try to play country, indie, classic, pop (I went through a bunch of Amazon playlist/channels) and your ears will beg you to stop. Alexa stop. Amazon stop. Computer stop. Echo stop. Edit - There was a firmware upgrade where the sound was partially fixed. I suspect it's just a hardwired equalizer setting, but the sound is still not as rich as it is from my original 1st Gen Echo. This new unit has the ability to play quite a bit louder than the original, but it's a POOR louder, still tinny & muffled. I'm going to keep my rating at 2-star, however, because I feel that the new Echo doesn't meet up to its marketed 'improved sound' tagline. Until Amazon miraculously replaces the speakers via download (haha) or comes up with some new amazing equalizer/sound processor, I've tied this unit to a soundbar, effectively using it as a Dot (which IS a 5-star review and costs $50 less )",

            "review_text": "So I've had this almost three weeks now. At first when I got it as a gift, I wasn't sure I was going to keep it. I mean, what does it REALLY do that's useful? Some friends told me they used it to control their TV. Great...a fancy clicker. But as time went on & I spent some time looking at her \"skills\" I've come to like her. LIKE...NOT LOVE, yet anyway. BY FAR my favorite thing is her \"Lists\". I added a shopping list & a to-do list. So if I'm cleaning & running low on Windex I just say, \"Alexa, add Windex to my shopping list\". Cooking & getting low on flour? \"Alexa add flour to my shopping list\". And she repeats it back to you. List is now in my phone, so no forgetting it at home anymore!! LOVE THIS. Worth the $100 just for this to me anyway. The \"To-do\" list is very good too, same sort of thing. I also use the calendar feature & she adds appointments to my phone calendar for me. The kids tell her their stuff too, so it goes on my calendar & I know what they got going on too. Every AM I ask her, \"Alexa what's on the calendar today\" & she tells me. She always knows when it's going to rain too. Hubby put the \"Red Alert\" sound (from the old Star Trek) in & he has her play that when he wants us to hurry up lol. I just ordered Hubby the Amazon Dot which co-ordinates with Alexa for Christmas. This way when he is in his downstairs office I don't have to text him for dinner anymore. Alexa & Dot work together as an intercom. Today I signed up for the 3 month trial of Amazon Music (99cents!). And I made an awesome Christmas carol playlist. Everyone from Mariah Carey & Maroon Five to Johnny Cash & Bing Crosby! Sound quality is very good. However, since Amazon Music is $7.99 a month, I asked Alexa to make a note on my calendar to cancel THAT right before the 3 months are up. Hoping Amazon realizes that is crazy monthly money before my trial is up so I can keep it. I think the yearly fee is less, so I'll look at that maybe. She is very good at understanding what you say. Even when you yell at her from the other room to turn the music volume up or down. I do plan to check regularly to see what \"new skills\" are added. How about one that has Alexa make a note when I feed the dog & then will tell Hubby when he gets home if I remembered to feed the dog or not? Or tell me that if I forgot? There is something sort of like that on there now, but it gets bad reviews. So someone needs to make a better skill for that. My kids tell me there is a skill where Alexa can send short texts to people for you. Got to look into that. So, I like her, but don't love her. Yet. I do think it's a good gift for someone who would like the \"list\" feature though. As long as they have smart phone & can use it to get the list up at the grocery store. UPDATE ON 12/15/17 - Still \"LIKE HER\" alot. Got an app on it called \"Dog Data\" that let's you tell her when you feed or let out the dog & when hubby comes home he can check to see if the dog was fed or let out, even if no one else is home. The \"lists & calendar\" are the best & most used feature for me. Love the sound on my Christmas playlist, have it going all the time when I'm home cleaning, cooking or wrapping Look forward to seeing what else she learns down the road..",

Pros: Alexa seems to be a bit more responsive and can hear me from across the small room - better than my previous Echo; also about $50 cheaper than my original Echo. Cons: No volume control on top of the new Echo like there was on the old one. An inconvenience for sure. And the volume control buttons on top of the unit are clumsy at best. Sometimes the volume doesn\u2019t change that much while holding down the buttons and then a few seconds later it changes.In spite of all the hype speakers don\u2019t sound any better than the original.

Is it true? Being a customer, you would always like to have the quality you have purchased should be at par with contemporary speakers available at $100 like JBL flip 4, Ue boom 2 etc. But, however, the quality of 2nd echo generation is not good enough though after recent firmware update the quality of sound bit improved especially vocals. I don't know how software updates could help improve sound of echo (2nd generation) further marred by hardware limitations.The lows and highs lacks definition and bass. I wonder why a company like amazon ( a big big company) has to fix problem by releasing software updates just after the echo launched. Its very unfortunate when company consistently promise to deliver by saying big words like true immersive 360 degree room filing sound on next generation speaker, but actually its not. If, you are a music lover, you may not experience immersive sound quality with detail, however, music ith prominent vocal, podcast, radio etc. are very good.

It doesn't seem to learn or give consistent answers either. In case I didn't enunciate well enough or word my questions in a way that AI couldn't determine what I wanted, I asked the same questions to my google phone app, and it has answered every one correctly. For example, what I thought would be an easy one for an Amazon related AI was \"What is the title of some of the books written by Adelle Davis?\" The first time I asked, Alexa answered with something totally unrelated. The second time, a few days later, she said she couldn't answer that one. The third time she said \"If you want to see the books on your kindle touch the book tab and then touch show all books\". Google listed three of her most sold books and indicated she had written others as well. I asked Alexa \"Which President of the United States was a geologist\" and she didn't know, but the google app on my phone not only answered correctly, it gave me links describing his geology career, when he worked in gold mines in Australia, China, etc. I've asked Alexa if a local store was open on Sunday and she gave me today's (Saturday's) hours. My phone app will tell me hour by hour when rain is likely to start, so it might indicate low probability until 11AM so I know I can go for an early morning walk with out worry. Alexa will just say something like \"there is a 50% chance of rain today\". I am guessing this is mainly designed to place orders on Amazon and useful for little else, but there is no way I would trust it to do that. I would be afraid I would ask for rolls of toilet paper and end up with a Rolls Royce delivered instead. I sure hope it learns and gets better with time.",

For home automation, I run the first gen Hook Smart Home Hub and the second gen Samsung SmartThings Smart Hub with a bunch of Sengled Element Programmable LED Smart Bulbs. The hook never misses a command but the Samsung has issues from time to time. It's super frustrating to be standing in the dark with a bag of groceries fighting with Alexa over the lights. I really wish the companies would get this crap right. It's just Z-Wave people. I wish the Alexa app was better written. It's slow, sloppily designed and details are missing. As a software guy... the flaws drive me crazy. It's just lazy programming. I'd love to get a refund on the first gen Echo as it's never worked right and every time I turn it on, it makes all the second gen devices stupid in my house. You can't fix it.

I think Amazon is getting better at tweaking this thing, however it still has some tinkering to go. The first generation unit was perfect in audio quality. Amazon should have never advertised this Gen 2 device as having better sound then Gen 1. That is a poor business practice that can ruin a company. I bought two gen 2 units and sold my first generation units because I bought into the hype of that statement. After getting the second generation units, I felt duped. Keep the updates coming.

So....after reading the many many reviews of how 'terrible' the sound is on the Echo 2nd gen, well....I just have to sit back and scratch my head. I don't get it. Look....this isn't some high end Bose or Klipsh speaker here. I'm not expecting to sit here and marvel at the superb sound that some seem to think they should be getting. I listened to several songs from different decades, and songs that I know well, meaning the instruments and what I should be hearing, and how I should be hearing them. One song I tested was 'Crystal Blue Persuasion' by Tommy James. Again....I sat back and scratched my head. Asking myself 'what are they talking about. I did this several more times, and even got silly with 'Inna-Godda-Da-Vida' by Iron Butterfly. And then Jazz...swing...blues...etc, etc, etc. either I'm suddenly kidding myself...or many of you don't know what 'good sound is'. There is nothing wrong with this version of Echo. And yes...I have the latest firmware. For a 2.5 inch sub, and a smaller up firing tweeter, this is AWESOME!!! I wouldn't consider sending this back for any reason.

            "review_text": "Love it and I will say that I am VERY HAPPY that I didn't listen to those negative reviews. Some people are just so negative and picky. Also keep in mind that these are NOT $500 perfect speakers. These are VERY GOOD speakers that are splendid and do an excellent job for what they are meant to do. If you want to run expensive speakers then buy the dot and bluetooth connect them. If you want to save money and absolutely enjoy a solid speaker then these new 2nd gen speakers are excellent, especially if you buy a 3 pack (while the special is still running). And yes, I do own an extreme sound system for my music and movies that has around 3000 watts, 3 (800 watt subs), a 1500 watt center speaker, 4 rear speakers and 2 tower speakers. Complete overkill. So..., do I know good sound?! Yes! That is why I rate these small cylinder speakers excellent for what they do, which is a lot! The music is clear and concise, meaning not muddled, and Alexa's voice is strong but not overbearing, but very pleasant. Most times I am asking for the volume down as I do not need it any louder. We mostly use Alexa for instant information, room filling music, news, and book reading. We have these around the house for instant exercise music, relaxation music and we use the room to room speakers for an intercom system which works excellent!!! We also love making Group of speakers play the same thing in a certain area which sounds awesome! We use it for recipes too! And we love how quick Alexa is! Even on loud volume everything is clear, including using the Drop In intercom system and when someone is talking too loud it does not disrupt the speaker. It is absolutely clear. Our teenage daughter has an issue with shouting into the mic. Uh we hear you sweetie. Lol All in all, again it is sad that there are so many negative people that love to be negative. On a scale of 1-10, for the money, these are around a 9 with 10 being perfect and there are not many perfect things in this world except the perception of perfection, which Amazon has done a darn good close replica of that word!!!! Thank you Amazon!!! And yes, I paid with my own money for all of the speakers, Amazon did not give me any money or deals to write this. I honestly was just mad at the negative reviews. ;-) Enjoy!!!",

The commands are straightforward, just use the Google commands such as Convert, Translate, define, etc. You can also ask it about the time, about the temperature outside. I suppose some people may find that discovering all the commands would be an adventure. I just wish they'd put them in the help section. Speaking of setup, if you want to find the serial number of your device, get a microscope or magnifying glass. It's in tiny tiny numbers and letters on the bottom of the box. If you have more than one to set up, you'll have to know the serial number so you know which one you're working with. But the biggest problem I have with it is the nonadjustable bass. After some finagling, I got it to play my Amazon music library (although I don't have all the kinks worked out of that yet). There's tons of bass, and there's no way to reduce it. I've tried all kinds of commands and requests, but Alexa just doesn't understand. I think it's probably a good speaker setup (tweeter and woofer), but there's no way to tell because of all the bass. Amazon should put an EQ control in the app or a knob for EQ adjustment on the Echo. I'm really tempted to send it back because of this.",

I check the app and it shows the answer multiple times. - I ask \"set a reminder\" and it responds 80% of the time that it's \"having trouble understanding right now\". - 30% of the time when it does respond, it cuts off in mid-sentence. - Asking it to play a song or my Amazon playlist is like pulling teeth. It either just doesn't respond or it can't understand. - I only use my echo dot to get the 'question of the day' because I can't rely on my Echo to not drop out of the program. - Even when it does respond correctly, I find myself having to use a very loud voice to get that response. I was excited to try this product, but now I have to say it is primarily a waste of money. I find myself trying to use it less and less. In fact, I have even resorted to just using my smart home app to turn on my lights instead of fighting with the Echo to get the job done. I am constantly sending feedback to Amazon, but there doesn't seem to be any improvement making this product not worth the hassle.

First it sputtered over setting up correctly but after a few tries it finally worked (I am not a novice - I have two Echo Dots which I have set up without any issues). Then it refused to play any music - whether that is from the radio, prime music or any other source. It was acknowledge what I was asking for (demonstrating that it understood and was connected to the internet) but then would do absolutely nothing. Amazon email customer support said they were aware of the issue and that the engineering team would solve it soon. As I looked for other reviews and forum postings noting the same issue, I realized that what Amazon customer service was telling me was pure fiction because I couldn't find anyone with the same issue. Unplugging and re-plugging in would cause it to work but only temporarily so I wrote back to customer support who asked for me to call them. They got me to restore to factory settings and after this it worked for a while. But then it stopped working altogether - dead. Completely dead. I un/re-plugged in and it started up but now I couldn't connect to wifi. I called customer support and two tech folks later they agreed to replace. I then got an email from Amazon stating that I should both return the defective unit to them AND dispose of it. I have absolute faith that Amazon would do the right thing and indeed they are but boy....it took too many phone calls, too many questions to determine what I always knew - that the unit was defective and even then customer service's response was contradictory and confusing (I still dont know whether I have to return the defective unit!?!). I really hope the replacement is better as it seems much nicer in so many ways to the Echo Dot. I will update this review when I get it up and running but I want to post this so that anyone else that has the same issue knows they are not alone.",

Just like when my batteries are low in the remote for my Smart TV my TV starts to act glitchy. I change the batteries in the remote and my TV works perfectly again. Whatever device you use to set up your Echo (or alexa device) be sure the software and apps are fully updated. Now it works as well as my Tap and Echo Dot. Simple fix and you would think Amazon would suggest this! Now the sound quality seems fine but I am not an audiophile nor would I expect Bose quality sound out of this. If your Echo is having trouble understanding you then use the feature to help it learn. The information provided about what this will and won't do is all available online so be sure you know what you're getting before you buy. FIRST REVIEW HAD ONE STAR: Have a 1st Gen Tap that I LOVE and Echo Dot that works well. HATE the new Echo I received last week. HATE it. 90% of the time she does NOT do what I ask. Lights up and either doesn't respond, or tells me how to enable a skill that is already enabled. I walk into the other room and speak to my Tap and she responds immediately with the correct request. Why the hell doesn't my Echo work the same way?? They are set up on the same account so I am baffled. I see they have discontinued the Tap and I hate that. I am ready to send my Echo back and buy a refurbished Tap instead.",
